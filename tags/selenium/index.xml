Some people love a bit of JS, others Ruby, and still others prefer C# or Java.
To complicate matters, there’s plenty of pieces we want to share between the language bindings you’ll be using. Examples include the “atoms” (re-usable pieces of javascript that perform common functions – such as “isDisplayed” or “getAttribute” – that we want to work the same way no matter which language you prefer to write tests in), things like our CDP support, which uses shared files that describe all the available functions we can call, and the new Selenium Manager, which is written in Rust, but we bundle with each of the language bindings.</description></item><item><title>Java 8 support in Selenium</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/java-8-support/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/java-8-support/</guid><description>“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” is a saying you may have heard, but sometimes it’s necessary to move on from our old favorites.

Kubernetes (K8S) works wonders for scaling up and down applications based on their CPU and Memory usage, but it is not so straightforward when it comes down to applications like Selenium Grid.
The issue is described quite well in this blog post. But in short, the Horizontal Pod AutoScaler (HPA) that is built into Kubernetes checks (by default) for resource consumption to determine if a deployment needs to be scaled up or down.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 4.4.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/selenium-4-4-0-released/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/selenium-4-4-0-released/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re very happy to announce the release of Selenium 4.4.0.

This, in an effort to offer a more inclusive environment for Selenium users who do not have English as their mother tongue.
This effort grew organically, and we got many pull requests adding content for different languages. Over time, some translations got to a very good state, and others didn&amp;rsquo;t get much attention. This brought the situation where 9 different languages are available in the documentation, but only a few add value to the readers.</description></item><item><title>A Tour of 4: New Commands</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/a-tour-of-4-new-commands/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/a-tour-of-4-new-commands/</guid><description>Before we ship Selenium 4, I thought it would be nice to introduce some of the new features in-depth.

If you’re already a Selenium user, this update should be as easy as just changing your dependency from 3.x to 4.0.0.

The first thing I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce you to is Selenium 4&amp;rsquo;s new-found ability to authenticate to websites. We&amp;rsquo;ve always been able to handle &amp;ldquo;form-based&amp;rdquo; authentication, where a login page has some INPUT elements that you need to enter the user name and password, but handling sites that use basic or digest authentication has always been harder.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 4 Release Candidate 2</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/selenium-4-rc-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/selenium-4-rc-2/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve listeneed and responded to the feedback from the first release candidate of Selenium 4, and we&amp;rsquo;re now happy to announce the second release candidate of Selenium 4.

Selenium IDE (or as we’ll refer to it from here on out – the Legacy IDE) was, and is, dead.
Since then quite a lot has happened with the IDE. We have a new version of it which we are referring to as… Selenium IDE!
It is currently in “alpha” and available for use in both Chrome and Firefox.</description></item><item><title>Firefox 55 and Selenium IDE</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2017/firefox-55-and-selenium-ide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2017/firefox-55-and-selenium-ide/</guid><description>The bad news: from Firefox 55 onwards, Selenium IDE will no longer work.
The reasons for this are complex, but boil down to two main causes:
Browsers are complicated pieces of software that are constantly evolving. Mozilla has been working hard to make Firefox faster and more stable, while still retaining the flexibility and ease of extension that we’ve come to know and love. As part of that process, Firefox is switching extensions from the original “XPI” format, to a newer, more widely adopted “Web Extension” mechanism.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 3.0: Out Now!</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-0-out-now/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-0-out-now/</guid><description>We are very pleased to announce the release of Selenium 3.0.

I’m looking forward to seeing you there!
One of the plans we’ve had from the very beginning for SeConf was that it was going to be a conference for the community of people who make Selenium such a fun project to work on. One way to do this was to host the conference where the largest groups of people using Selenium are found.</description></item><item><title>Android and iOS Support</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2013/android-and-ios-support/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2013/android-and-ios-support/</guid><description>TL;DR: We’re retiring Selenium’s own AndroidDriver and iPhoneDriver in favour of any of Selendroid, iosdriver and Appium. If you’re using one of Selenium’s own mobile drivers, please evaluate one of these alternatives.
The longer version:
In 2007, Steve Jobs announced the iPhone and changed the mobile Web from a curiosity to something the mainstream wanted and used.

Projects such as Appium, iosdriver, and Selendroid have all shown that this approach works, and works well. On the Web, if you start using Selenium WebDriver with one browser (Firefox, for example), it’s easy to switch out the browser for another one (such as Internet Explorer or Chrome).</description></item><item><title>The Road to Selenium 3</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2013/the-road-to-selenium-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2013/the-road-to-selenium-3/</guid><description>Selenium 2 was released in July 2011. It’s now two years old, and what a couple of years it’s been! The WebDriver APIs, which were the major addition in Selenium 2, are now the basis for a W3C standard, and there are implementations written and supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera. There have been 34 releases, with official support for Java, C#, Python, Ruby and Javascript, and the community has stepped in to provide bindings for Perl, PHP and others.</description></item><item><title>Curious to know how we picked speakers for the 2013 SeConf?

Selenium/Webdriver has kept my family fed since 2007. Since I’ve never committed a line of code to this magical project, I thought the least I could do was spend a few hours helping put SeConf 2013 together. When they asked for a volunteer to put the speaker program together, I was thrilled to step forward!</description></item><item><title>Selenium Conf 2013: Call for Papers and Early Bird Tickets</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2013/selenium-conf-2013-call-for-papers-and-early-bird-tickets/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2013/selenium-conf-2013-call-for-papers-and-early-bird-tickets/</guid><description>This year’s Selenium Conference is slated for June 10 – 12 in beautiful Boston, Massachusetts.

Download it now! — so I thought it best to let you know. We’re aiming to head back to faster releases, so hopefully you won’t see another blog post about the release for a while (though I’m sure they’ll appear in the “Smatterings of Selenium” posts)</description></item><item><title>Announcing Selenium 2.22</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/announcing-selenium-2-22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/announcing-selenium-2-22/</guid><description>It’s been a while since the last Selenium release, but I’m happy to announce that Selenium 2.22 is now available for download. This is a big release for us and features two major changes.
The first is that Selenium 2.22 is the first version that requires Java 6 in order to run. This has been the case for the Selenium Server for some time, but this is the first time the client code has required Java 6.</description></item><item><title>Selenium Conf: Community</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/selenium-conf-community/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/selenium-conf-community/</guid><description>In this series of blog posts we’ve introduced one of the keynotes and talked about some of the great presentations you’ll see at Selenium Conf ’12, but so far we’ve missed the most important aspect of the entire event: you.

There are talks aimed at every level of Selenium user. We’ve got experience reports, so you can learn from the trials and tribulations of others. There are talks about using Selenium in unusual ways, such as performance testing, or automated security testing, so you can see new ideas and approaches.
There are technical talks, such as the one Jim Evans is giving on lessons learned from developing the IE driver, so you can learn a little bit more about how Selenium works and Luke Daley’s talk about Geb is bound to be fun.</description></item><item><title>Selenium Conf Keynotes: Liz Keogh</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/selenium-conf-keynotes-liz-keogh/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/selenium-conf-keynotes-liz-keogh/</guid><description>The tickets for Selenium Conf ’12 are still on sale for about another week, so there’s still time for you to buy your tickets. In case you’ve not already gone to the conference site to see the great line up, this week we’ll be letting you know what to expect!
I’m really pleased to announce that Liz Keogh, who is a core member of the Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) community and is one of the stalwarts of the London Agile community, as well as a haiku poet, is going to be one of our keynotes!</description></item><item><title>Selenium Conference 2012</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/selenium-conference-2012/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/selenium-conference-2012/</guid><description>Good news, everybody! Selenium Conf ’12 is getting closer! We recently selected the speakers for the conference, and it’s going to be a great mix of talks, spanning the full range of subjects from the very practical to the deeply technical. I’m promised that there will be robots.
Selenium Conf isn’t just about the planned talks, it’s also about the community. On the final day, there will be an unconference, so if there’s something you feel passionately about and feel the world should know, now’s your chance.</description></item><item><title>Support for Ancient Browsers</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/support-for-ancient-browsers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/support-for-ancient-browsers/</guid><description>The first code checked into the Selenium project’s public repository was in November, 2004. We’re now in 2012. In the intervening years there have been many browsers released. The last browser we officially stopped supporting was Firefox 2.0, and it’s time to review the list of browsers again.
We periodically review the list of supported browsers as the more changes there are between the oldest version of a browser that we support and the most recent, the harder it is for us to add new features and maintain those that already exist.</description></item><item><title>A Note About the Cybervillains SSL Certificate</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/a-note-about-the-cybervillains-ssl-certificate/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/a-note-about-the-cybervillains-ssl-certificate/</guid><description>If you&amp;#8217;re using Selenium RC to test websites hosted on a secure site (accessed using a URL starting with HTTPS), we strongly recommend that you upgrade to Selenium 2.19.

There’s one big user facing changing that we’d like to tell you about: the webdriver-backed selenium can now be used in supported languages.
By providing this capability, it’s possible to migrate from RC to the WebDriver APIs without rewriting all your tests in one fell swoop (which must be a Good Thing, right?) An example of how to use it in Python would be:</description></item><item><title>Selenium 2.16 Released: Welcome to 2012!</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/selenium-2-16-released-welcome-to-2012/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/selenium-2-16-released-welcome-to-2012/</guid><description>It’s been a while since we last blogged about a Selenium release. Since the release of 2.0, we’ve been attempting to give you a fresh and shiny Selenium release every week (though, in reality, we’re managing to get you one every 10 days on average).

Last year, we held the first official Selenium Conference in San Francisco, and it was both great fun and a huge success. It is therefore with great pleasure that we are announcing Selenium Conf ’12!

As well as improving the stability of Grid under high loads, we’ve added an experimental (and temporary!) feature that allows the Firefox driver to use a different mechanism for determining when a page is loaded. This is designed to handle the case where the driver appears to hang, as it’s waiting for all incoming requests to complete before continuing. How to enable this mode is listed in the changelog.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 2.8 Released</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-8-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-8-released/</guid><description>In keeping with our (roughly) weekly releases, Selenium 2.8 was released today (and on Maven too), with a *huge* list of bug-fixes! As well as improved stability, if you’re using the Java API, this release adds the ability to upload files to a RemoteWebDriver server (see RemoteWebDriver.setFileDetector (http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/remote/RemoteWebDriver.html#setFileDetector(org.openqa.selenium.remote.FileDetector))).
Particular thanks have to go out to our two newest committers, Alexei Barancev and Ajay Kemparaj, for the copious bug-fixes they’ve contributed!</description></item><item><title>Selenium 2.6 Released</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-6-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-6-released/</guid><description>If you’ve been watching this blog carefully you’ll have noticed that the last release announcement we made was for 2.3, so it may come as a surprise that we’re announcing that 2.6 has been released (even on Maven!). Don’t worry: 2.4 and 2.5 were released on time and without muss or fuss. 2.6, on the other hand has been almost three weeks brewing.

The release notes for this version are pretty slim:
Better detection of clickable areas in Firefox. Merge of Google-contributed code into the underlying javascript libraries used by the drivers. We’ve also fixed bugs, one of which was being a nuisance for users of IBM’s JRE.

We’re proud to announce the release of Selenium 2.2. What’s new this time? For many users, this is simply a bug fix release as there are no new major features. One thing you might appreciate is better exceptions (http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/IllegalLocatorException.html) being thrown when xpath searches return something other than a web element when using the WebDriver APIs, and we’re continuing to tweak the emulation of user events.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 2.1 Released</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-1-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-1-released/</guid><description>Now that Selenium 2 has been released, one of the goals of the project is to provide regular updates to our users and the community. The aim is for these updates to be small and manageable, incrementally addressing issues and problems raised by you. Selenium 2.1, which is launched today, marks the first of these regular, small releases.
Selenium 2.1 is largely focused on improving Grid with a host of minor improvements including better tracking of “orphaned” browser instances.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 2.0: Out Now!</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0/</guid><description>We are very, very pleased to announce the release of Selenium 2.0. If you’ve been waiting for a stable release since 1.0.3, now’s the chance to update. And if you do, what will you find?
For users of Selenium 1, this is a drop-in replacement. You’ll find support for modern browsers such as Firefox 5 and IE 9, as well as a wealth of bug fixes and stability improvements. That’s one reason to update, but what other reasons are there?</description></item><item><title>Selenium IDE 1.0.12 – now with Firefox 5 support</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-ide-1-0-12-firefox-5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-ide-1-0-12-firefox-5/</guid><description>Last week we quietly released Selenium IDE 1.0.12 on the website.

We very quickly got some feedback that encouraged us to push a 2.0rc2. Now, after just under three weeks, we’re launching a third and final release candidate. You can download it from the Selenium HQ site or directly from Google Code.
We think we’ve addressed many of the common issues, added some polish and added a host of bug fixes and minor changes, and we hope to hear your feedback!</description></item><item><title>Selenium 2.0rc2: The Better Working Release</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0rc2-the-better-working-release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0rc2-the-better-working-release/</guid><description>You win some and you lose some. We’d been really pleased to get Selenium 2.0rc1 out, so we were pretty disappointed to hear that some of you were running into problems with the Java version of the IE driver not launching IE sometimes. That’s definitely not good, so we fixed the problems and have released Selenium 2.0rc2. It’s the same as rc1, but with fewer problems 🙂
We’re still very keen to hear your feedback!</description></item><item><title>Selenium 2.0rc1: The Grid Release</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0rc1-the-grid-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0rc1-the-grid-release/</guid><description>We’re very happy to announce the first Release Candidate for Selenium 2, available for Java, C#, Ruby and Python. The API has been stabilised and the functionality needed for the final 2.0 release is mostly in.

From most people’s perspective, this won’t make much difference: you’ll still be able to view the documentation and download the latest versions of Selenium from Selenium HQ.</description></item><item><title>2.0b1 and Maven</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/2-0b1-and-maven/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/2-0b1-and-maven/</guid><description>If you’re using Maven and the 2.0b1 release of Selenium, you may be running into some problems getting maven to pick up your tests.

It’s available for Java, C# and Ruby. If you’ve been holding off trying Selenium 2 because of the alpha label, then the biggest improvement you’ll see is with the new WebDriver APIs, but there’s a lot more!
A promise of relatively stable APIs For Firefox only right now, an API for dealing with alerts, prompts and confirms (http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebDriver.TargetLocator.html#alert()).

Again, if you’re interested in the internal workings of Selenium 2, then please skip straight to something else. If you’re interested in how and why we made some of the technical decisions on the project, keep reading….
We left our intrepid heroes in a tight spot: they’d decided to write a shared library of code, to be used by the various webdriver implementations and selenium core, but the requirements for doing this seemed to be at odds with it actually happening.</description></item><item><title>Going Atomic: Why?</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/going-atomic-why/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/going-atomic-why/</guid><description>This is the first in a series of technical posts by me about the internals of Selenium WebDriver. If you’re not interested in technical nitty-gritty, then feel free to step away now.
Still here? Excellent.
Let’s take a step back to just before the Selenium and WebDriver projects merged. There were, very obviously, two separate codebases. Looking closer and with a slightly different perspective, there were more than this. We used the test suites for webdriver to define the behaviour for multiple, largely independent, driver codebases.</description></item><item><title>How to use Selenium 2 with Maven</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/how-to-use-selenium-2-with-maven/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/how-to-use-selenium-2-with-maven/</guid><description>There are several ways to use Selenium 2:
If you don’t have Selenium 1.x legacy code, you might want to directly use on of the new WebDriver implemenations like ChromeDriver, HtmlUnitDriver, FirefoxDriver, or InternetExplorerDriver which provide a nice, small and easy to learn API. If you have Selenium 1.x legacy code, you can still use the well known DefaultSelenium class or the new WebDriverBackedSelenium, which extends DefaultSelenium but uses one of the WebDriver implementations internally.</description></item><item><title>The Current Status of Selenium 1 and Selenium 2</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/the-current-status-of-selenium-1-and-selenium-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/the-current-status-of-selenium-1-and-selenium-2/</guid><description>In the beginning there was Se1, and it was good. But it could have been better — in ways that WebDriver was starting to be good at. Thus the brilliant idea was hatched to merge the two projects.
And then the confusion began. Let’s see if I can start to address some of it via a ficticious conversation that consolidates the Se-user list and #selenium irc channel.
There are a couple annoying bugs in Se-RC 1.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 2.0a5 Released</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-2-0a5-released/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-2-0a5-released/</guid><description>I’m pleased to announce the release of Selenium 2.0a5, available for immediate download. This release brings a host of changes under the hood, and represents the efforts of many contributors. Highlights include:
New interfaces (http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/html5/package-frame.html) for dealing with HTML 5 elements. An API for implicit waits (http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebDriver.Timeouts.html): quietly waiting until an element is present before continuing with a test. You can use them like this: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(15, TimeUnit.SECONDS) A revamped Firefox driver.</description></item><item><title>Selenium IDE – Looking back and looking forward</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-ide-looking-back-and-looking-forward/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-ide-looking-back-and-looking-forward/</guid><description>Its been around six months and three releases since I took the reins of Selenium-IDE. The fundamental change in that time has been the adoption of a plugin model like the fine folks over that Firebug. (We’re also self-hosting it which is big from a project internals perspective.)
Right now, you can add custom user-extensions and formatters, but in the very near future you will be able to add location strategies as well.</description></item><item><title>Selenium Grid 1.0.8 Released</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-grid-1-0-8-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-grid-1-0-8-released/</guid><description>We’re pleased to announce the release of Selenium Grid 1.0.8.

The delay was due to some internal build changes and not code, but one of the code changes that is there more than makes up for the delay.
That’s right, drag-and-drop has finally arrived to Se-IDE — though credit lies with Jérémy Hérault for implementing it.

You can download it now (http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-remote-control-1.0.3.zip).
There is no functional difference between this version and 1.0.2, other than it is packaged up a little nicer and we’ve clarified the relationship between selenium-server and the client drivers. That is: we are not releasing new client drivers with future 1.x releases. The reason is that we locked down the API in version 1.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 1.0.2 Released: Firefox 3.6 and Snow Leopard Support</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-1-0-2-release-firefox-3-6-and-snow-leopard-support/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-1-0-2-release-firefox-3-6-and-snow-leopard-support/</guid><description>Today we’re happy to announce that Selenium Remote Control 1.0.2 has been released.
