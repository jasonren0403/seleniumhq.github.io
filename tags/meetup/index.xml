We&amp;rsquo;ve gone out of our way to reflect this feeling at the conference. We have engrossing keynotes, well-researched talks, hands-on pre-conference workshops, hallway tracks, and whatnot!
Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick list of what to expect! What&amp;rsquo;s cooking in Keynotes? We have Diego Molina kicking things off with &amp;lsquo;Selenium: State of the Union&amp;rsquo; where he will talk about all things Selenium, including the project, the code, and the community.</description></item><item><title>SeleniumConf Chicago 2023 Speakers Announced</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/seleniumconf-chicago-2023-update/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/seleniumconf-chicago-2023-update/</guid><description>As many of you know, the Selenium Conference returns to an in-person event next March 28-30, 2023 in Chicago, IL.

Selenium Meetups are great, but… Have you ever wanted to attend a Selenium Meetup but there’s not one near you? Or maybe there is but something’s come up and you can’t make it out that night? Or maybe the meetup near you struggles to get good speakers and have a consistent schedule?</description></item></channel></rss>
