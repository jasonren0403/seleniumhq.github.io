<time datetime=2010-12-24 class=text-body-secondary>Friday, December 24, 2010</time></div><p>We recently released the first of the betas for Selenium 2. It’s available for Java, C# and Ruby. If you’ve been holding off trying Selenium 2 because of the alpha label, then the biggest improvement you’ll see is with the new WebDriver APIs, but there’s a lot more!</p><ul><li>A promise of relatively stable APIs</li><li>For Firefox only right now, an API for dealing with alerts, prompts and confirms (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebDriver.TargetLocator.html#alert()</code>).</li><li>A brand new IE driver.</li><li>Better selenium emulation (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebDriverBackedSelenium.html</code>) when using webdriver</li><li>And a better implementation of webdriver’s API backed by the traditional Selenium technology (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/SeleneseCommandExecutor.html</code>).</li><li>Ubiquitous use of <a href=http://sizzlejs.com/>Sizzle</a> for emulating CSS selectors where native CSS selectors aren’t supported</li><li>The advanced user interactions (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/interactions/package-frame.html</code>) API</li><li>An update to the AndroidDriver’s Android app.</li></ul><p>Of course, we’d love this release to be completely bug free, but this is, after all, a beta, so there are some known issues:</p><ul><li>The selenium 1.x emulation using IE is a little flaky.</li><li>The ChromeDriver is not as capable as the others.</li><li>Anything in our <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list>bug list</a>.</li></ul><p>You can download it from here:</p><p><a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list>http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list</a></p><p>You can read the javadocs (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/index.html</code>) and the ruby docs (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/index.html</code>).</p><p>An obvious question is “When will the beta end?” The short answer is when we’ve implemented the alerts and prompts and advanced user interactions APIs in all supported browsers. We expect there to be some flex in some APIs (removing deprecated methods, and within the advanced user interactions API) but what you have here is basically what you’re going to get when we hit 2.0 final. I have no idea how long this will take, but if you’re interested in helping out, <a href=http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-developers>let us know!</a></p><p>Thanks are due to all the committers who have worked so hard to get this code into shape. Thanks are also due to all the people who have taken the time to file bugs, ask for features and participated on the mailing lists. Thank you to you too, for going out and trying this new beta of Selenium 2.</p><p>You rock. 🙂</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-6e0b0ef3c3bd6f42ca69488de92726e5>Atoms have come to Selenium IDE</h1><div class=lead>As mentioned in Simon’s Going Atomic: Why? and Going Atomic: How, part of the merging of Selenium and WebDriver is to share common code between the two.</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Adam Goucher (<a href=https://twitter.com/adamgoucher>@adamgoucher</a>)</b> |
<time datetime=2010-12-09 class=text-body-secondary>Thursday, December 09, 2010</time></div><p>As mentioned in Simon’s <a href=/blog/2010/going-atomic-why/>Going Atomic: Why?</a> and <a href=/blog/2010/going-atomic-how/>Going Atomic: How</a>, part of the merging of Selenium and WebDriver is to share common code between the two. And as of the 1.0.10 release of Selenium IDE, this merged code, ‘atoms’ is now included.</p><p>Some early users of this release are noticing that this the atom that drives assertAttribute and verifyAttribute is causing their scripts to break. This post explains the ‘why’ and suggests how to fix them as well.</p><p>The HTML spec has the notion of a <em>boolean attribute</em> which is one that does something just by being there rather than by its value; <em>checked</em> and <em>selected</em> are two such examples of this. Optionally, you could give these boolean attributes a value that is the same as their name (checked=”checked”) and your page would still validate, but really, the browsers only care that the attribute exist.</p><p>Prior to 1.0.10, it was not uncommon for people to do something like</p><pre tabindex=0><code>  assertAttribute | checkbox@checked | checked
</code></pre><p>which fetches the value of the checked attribute on the checkbox with the id or name of checkbox and fails the script is the value is not checked.</p><p>In 1.0.10 though, that will fail <em>even if it is checked</em>. This is because checked is a boolean attribute and will now return either true or throw an exception saying the attribute doesn’t exist. Redoing the above step check that the boolean attribute is set results in:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>  assertAttribute | checkbox@checked | true
</code></pre><p>Thankfully, most of the real-world interaction with boolean attributes is focused on checked, disabled, hidden and selected and in these cases using assertAttribute is not really the right thing to do. Instead, the Selenium API provides wrappers for you to use.<br></p><table><tr><td>checked</td><td>assertChecked(locator), assertNotChecked(locator), verifyChecked(locator), verifyNotChecked(locator)</td></tr><tr><td>disabled</td><td>assertEditable(locator), assertNotEditable(locator), verifyEditable(locator), verifyNotEditable(locator)</td></tr><tr><td>hidden</td><td>assertVisible(locator), assertNotVisible(locator), verifyVisible(locator), verifyNotVisible(locator)</td></tr><tr><td>selected</td><td>assertSelected*(locator, pattern), assertNotSelected*(locator, pattern), verifySelected*(locator, pattern), verifyNotSelected*(locator, pattern)</td></tr></table><p>Checking for the absence of a boolean attribute that doesn’t have a nice wrapper is a bit of a pain though. In this example I am checking that the boolean attribute <em>multiple</em> is not on the select element with the name elephants.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>  assertEval | this.browserbot.findElement(&#34;css=select[name=elephants]&#34;).getAttribute(&#34;multiple&#34;); | null
</code></pre><p>If you find yourself doing this very often, I suggest you wrap it up in a user-extension inside a <a href=http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/plugins.html>plugin</a> as something like</p><pre tabindex=0><code>  assertBooleanAttribute | css=select[name=elephants]@multiple | false
  assertBooleanAttribute | css=select[name=elephants]@multiple | true
</code></pre><p>Hopefully this addresses some of the eventual ‘why the heck did my script break!?!?!’ problems that will no double crop up once Selenium IDE 1.0.10 gets wider distribution.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-8e8b0a4ca9bbdd7c16d1de94722d0b8a>A Smattering of Selenium #35</h1><div class=lead>(If I wasn’t still recovering from a cold there would be something witty here.)</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Adam Goucher (<a href=https://twitter.com/adamgoucher>@adamgoucher</a>)</b> |

Head over to the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list>downloads page</a> to get it while it’s hot, or wait just a little bit longer for it to appear in a maven repo near you. The .Net version will also be updated soon too, and the python and <a href=http://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver>ruby libraries</a> have been having smaller, more frequent releases all this time.</p><p>You’ll be pleased to hear that the Selenium 1.0 APIs have remained constant, so what’s changed? Here, in no particular order are the major changes you’ll find in 2.0a6:</p><ul><li>Android support: you can now <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/detail?name=android-server-2.0a6.apk">download the APK</a> and run webdriver tests using Android 1.6 to 2.2.</li><li>Firefox 4 support.</li><li>Experimental IE9 support</li><li>New APIs for dealing with HTML5 elements (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/html5/package-summary.html</code>) (best implemented, for now, by the mobile webdrivers)</li><li>A richer .Net API</li><li>A move to <a href=http://sizzlejs.com/>Sizzle</a> for locating elements using CSS in browsers that don’t have a native API for that.</li><li>Far better support for running your existing Selenium RC tests using WebDriver, helping you make a managed migration to the newer APIs.</li></ul><p>There are also lots of nice touches for the more technically inclined, including the ability to re-use instances of FirefoxProfiles (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/firefox/FirefoxProfile.html</code>), better configurability when requesting a remote webdriver instance, better resource management and more shared code between the Selenium and WebDriver implementations.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to report a bug on our <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list>issue tracker</a>, or raised problems on one of our <a href=https://groups.google.com/group/webdriver>mailing</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-users">lists</a>, or shown up for some of the banter on the IRC channel: without your involvement, the project wouldn’t be half as much fun, and wouldn’t be as capable as it is. Thanks are also due to the development team, who have poured an enormous amount of work into this release (538 revisions in under 90 days, or about 6 check-ins each and every day)</p><p>Hope you like it!</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-b8f11ed7520e893393be86237e58e3d0>A Smattering of Selenium #29</h1><div class=lead>A fair number of links this week.

Again, if you’re interested in the internal workings of Selenium 2, then please skip straight to something else. If you’re interested in how and why we made some of the technical decisions on the project, keep reading….</p><p>We left our intrepid heroes in a tight spot: they’d decided to write a shared library of code, to be used by the various webdriver implementations and selenium core, but the requirements for doing this seemed to be at odds with it actually happening.</p><p>Fortunately, at about the same time we started down this path, Google Open Sourced the <a href=https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler>Closure compiler</a>. This is a Javascript compiler that takes as input a set of Javascript files, and which outputs Javascript. It can be configured to either pass the code through untouched into a single file, or it can compile a script aggressively, removing unused code-paths and minifying the output as much as possible. The Closure compiler is used on a lot of Google products, so we know that it’s reliable and consistent.</p><p>In order to get the best out of the Closure compiler, we’re writing the atoms using the <a href=https://github.com/google/closure-library>Closure library</a>. This isn’t as well known as some of the other JS libraries out there, but it’s solid, well tested and is being actively developed. It also features an easy-to-use extension of JsUnit, which makes writing tests a far simpler task than might otherwise be the case, and it has an easy to use mechanism for modularizing code.</p><p>So, given that we could compile a single Javascript function (and it’s dependencies) into a minified fragment of JS, we were all set, right? Not quite.</p><p>The problem is that the atoms are being extracted from two frameworks that have a different way of viewing the world. As an example, Selenium 1’s getAttribute (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/Selenium.html#getAttribute(java.lang.String)</code>) method only returns the value of a particular attribute, whereas WebDriver’s getAttribute (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#getAttribute(java.lang.String</code>)) method will return the value of either a property or an attribute (because sometimes it’s hard to remember whether something is an attribute or a property of an element)</p><p>As with all problems in computer science, an extra level of indirection is used to solve this issue.</p><p>We’re busy implementing the expected behaviour of both <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/#svn/trunk/common/src/js/webdriver>WebDriver’s</a> and <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/#svn/trunk/common/src/js/selenium%3Fstate%3Dclosed>Selenium’s</a> API on top of the atoms.</p><p>There is, of course, the obvious question about how we get this carefully compressed JS into a driver. One option would be to include the raw Javascript as files in each language binding, and pull them in as required. That’s possible, but it would make each language binding bloated, and would introduce a lot of duplication. The alternative is to push the atoms as far into the driver as possible, and this is what we do. As part of the build process for webdriver, we take the compressed JS and convert it into a form that can be consumed by a particular driver. For example, for the IE driver, we convert them into constants in a <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/jobbie/src/cpp/InternetExplorerDriver/atoms.h>C header file</a>. These constants can then be referred to by the driver and converted back into a script than be executed via the same mechanism that is used by “executeScript”.</p><p>What do we gain from this seemingly baroque approach? Other than the ability to share the same code between drivers? Many things. The cost of maintenance drops dramatically as we can fix a bug in one place and have that fix be picked up by every driver. Because we’re working in pure JS and just querying the DOM, we can run the unit tests in a browser whilst we’re developing the code. This leads to a very tight feedback cycle. It also makes it easier for developers not familiar with the code to take a look at how we do things, and send us patches (always appreciated!) Finally, we can ensure a consistency of result.</p><p>Right, any questions?</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-203dfa60661ae0a1bac98fac38bdb1b4>A Smattering of Selenium #25</h1><div class=lead>A day late, but that sort of thing happens when you have family.</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Adam Goucher (<a href=https://twitter.com/adamgoucher>@adamgoucher</a>)</b> |

<time datetime=2010-08-16 class=text-body-secondary>Monday, August 16, 2010</time></div><p>This is the first in a series of technical posts by me about the internals of Selenium WebDriver. If you’re not interested in technical nitty-gritty, then feel free to step away now.</p><p>Still here? Excellent.</p><p>Let’s take a step back to just before the Selenium and WebDriver projects merged. There were, very obviously, two separate codebases. Looking closer and with a slightly different perspective, there were more than this. We used the test suites for webdriver to define the behaviour for multiple, largely independent, driver codebases. The <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/#svn/trunk/jobbie>IE driver</a> was written in C, the HtmlUnit driver in Java and the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/#svn/trunk/firefox>Firefox driver</a> is largely Javascript, and so on.</p><p>This means that there was a lot of “congruent code”: code that performed the same function but was implemented in a different way. The natural result of this was there was the possibility for behaviour to diverge between drivers. Worse, it meant that when a bug was found, we had to check it in every browser, and it wasn’t certain that an individual could actually fix the code. After all, not everyone is comfortable writing in all the languages we use on the project, or is au fait with all the technologies. For an Open Source project like Selenium, this is a major problem: we rely on a relatively small core of key developers backed up with a far larger team of individuals submitting small changes and fixes. Anything that makes it harder for us to function effectively as a development community is a Bad Thing.</p><p>So, we wanted a way off the island; a mechanism that would make it easy to share code between the various drivers and selenium core, that allowed us to fix a bug in one place only and have that fix ripple out to every driver that made use of this mechanism. More importantly, it had to be easy to use, and for someone not familiar with a raft of languages and technologies to quickly get started with.</p><p>What would this mechanism look like? Well, there’s a few things that feed into this, but the most important one, was that a majority of the code we’d think of merging was querying the state of the browser (“find an element”, “get the value of this attribute”) and, as Jason Huggins would point out to me at the drop of a hat, the natural language for querying the state of a browser is Javascript. One of the nice things with Javascript is that it’s possible to get a nice, fast development cycle going in it. Just modify a test, save and then hit “refresh” in the browser. That’s kind of attractive. Better still, there are a lot of developers familiar with Javascript.</p><p>So, we decided to use Javascript.</p><p>Because this shared code was to be composed of the smallest useful fragments of functionality required for browser automation we decided to refer to them as “Browser Automation Atoms”, or “atoms” for short. Rather than write them from scratch, the easiest thing to do was to extract them from the existing code — this is stuff that’s been battle-tested, so we know it’s robust.</p><p>There was one very obvious fly in the ointment: not every driver is written in Javascript. Although we have a mechanism available (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/JavascriptExecutor.html</code>) in every browser for executing JS, it’s wildly inefficient to dump an enormous lump of code on to the JS engine of the browser whenever you want to query the DOM. After all, most of the code would not be needed, and not all JS engines have been created equal. Some are blazingly fast. Others, not so much.</p><p>It would also be nice to break the code up into manageably-sized modules, rather than being in a single, monolithic file, which implies some clever “module loading” capability. Except this code isn’t always going to be executing inside an environment where writing “script” tags to load additional scripts is possible. You can’t do that in the guts of a firefox extension, though you can load files other ways. However we tie modules together will need to cope with that.</p><p>Ah! These opposing requirements: small modules containing the functions we want to use, no extraneous code, and for everything to be in a single file in order to minimize the pain of loading additional modules.

<time datetime=2010-08-09 class=text-body-secondary>Monday, August 09, 2010</time></div><p>The GSoC 2010, it’s a great adventure.</p><p>I’m Raynatou, I come from Burkina and do my internship at <a href=http://www.serli.com/>SERLI</a>. Like all interns in this company the topic of my internship focuses on advanced topics like the integration of WebDriver as backend for Selenium IDE. Selenium IDE is currently built upon Selenium Core for interacting with web pages. Selenium Core has several major limitations, including the inability to fire native events. To avoid these limitations and produce more robust tests, I am investigating Selenium IDE to using WebDriver in place of Selenium Core.</p><p>I’m mentored by Eric Allen from <a href=http://saucelabs.com/>SauceLabs</a>, my lead mentor, and by Jérémy Hérault from SERLI, his second but not least ;).</p><p>Eric has already done most of this integration earlier this year. The goal of his work is mostly to show what’s possible with Selenium IDE and the Selenium 2.0 Firefox driver. It is based on an asynchronous communication between the Firefox WebDriver extension and Selenium IDE, Se-IDE waiting for that WebDriver says to him that the current command has been passed with success (or not) to call the next command of the current test case (use of callback function). The goal of my mission is to finalize this integration. However, Eric being a crazy man, and he has done it quickly and together we though to another way to do this merge.</p><p>Our new thinking is based on a synchronous communication between both of them. To do it, I get the FirefoxDriver instance and play with it like a normal object, by calling its methods. But the behaviour of FirefoxDriver isn’t as simple as I was thinking. JavaScript being a powerfull language (yes, it can make you shiver), I’ve had just to replace some objects (like Response object) and to use a Proxy (and a bit of IoC-like code) to simplify my life and the code to do. You can see my work on <a href=http://github.com/epall/selenium/commits/webdriver-synchronous>GitHub</a> and follow it.</p><p>Currently, I think that more than 95% of the Selenium API commands are usable with WebDriver as backend in Selenium IDE. The process was basically to go through the seleniumemulation package and port all of the Java classes into JavaScript methods on the WebDriver class.</p><p>Now, I’m working on Unit tests to cover any of the 2.0 work I’ve done. I managed to get all of the Selenium Core tests to run through IDE. I’ve some refactorings to do to optimize the code and add more comments for a bigger comprehension of my work. I have almost finished.</p><p>I hope you enjoy what I’m doing and we hope (me and my mentors) that this work can be included in the wave of Selenium 2.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-e45f44a7ac6062bcd6c911241d04336f>A Smattering of Selenium #22</h1><div class=lead>Happy Simcoe Day.

<time datetime=2010-07-30 class=text-body-secondary>Friday, July 30, 2010</time></div><p>There are several ways to use Selenium 2:</p><ol><li>If you don’t have Selenium 1.x legacy code, you might want to directly use on of the new WebDriver implemenations like ChromeDriver, HtmlUnitDriver, FirefoxDriver, or InternetExplorerDriver which provide a nice, small and easy to learn API.</li><li>If you have Selenium 1.x legacy code, you can still use the well known DefaultSelenium class or the new WebDriverBackedSelenium, which extends DefaultSelenium but uses one of the WebDriver implementations internally.</li></ol><p>Whichever option you prefer, if you have want to use Maven, all you need to do is add the following dependency to your pom.xml:</p><pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;selenium&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.0a5&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre><p>If you know, that you will only use a certain WebDriver implementation, e.g. the FirefoxDriver, you don’t need to depend on the selenium artifact (which has dependencies to all WebDriver implementations as well as the support classes). Instead you can add the dependency to just the artifact you need, e.g.</p><pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;selenium-firefox-driver&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.0a5&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre><p>When using a WebDriver implementation, there is no need to start a Selenium server – the browser will be directly started and remote controlled.</p><p>But if you are using DefaultSelenium (or the RemoteWebDriver implementation), you still need to start a Selenium server.</p><p>The best way is to download the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/detail?name=selenium-server-standalone-2.0a5.jar">standalone Selenium server jar</a> and just use it.</p><p>Furthermore you can also embed the Selenium server into your own project, if you add the following dependency to your pom.xml:</p><pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;selenium-server&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.0a5&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre><p>Now you can create a SeleniumServer instance yourself and start it.</p><p>Be aware, that the selenium-server artifact has a dependency to the servlet-api-2.5 artifact, which you need to exclude, if your project will be run in a web application container.</p><p>Well, I hope that covers everything you need to know on how to use Selenium 2 with Maven.</p><p>Michael</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-3d92725a7b6eeaf095aba96b379b7295>A Smattering of Selenium #21</h1><div class=lead>I thought it had been a slow week — until I looked at how many browser windows I had open.</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Adam Goucher (<a href=https://twitter.com/adamgoucher>@adamgoucher</a>)</b> |

<time datetime=2010-07-21 class=text-body-secondary>Wednesday, July 21, 2010</time></div><p>In the beginning there was Se1, and it was good. But it could have been better — in ways that WebDriver was starting to be good at. Thus the brilliant idea was hatched to merge the two projects.</p><p>And then the confusion began. Let’s see if I can start to address some of it via a ficticious conversation that consolidates the Se-user list and #selenium irc channel.</p><p><em>There are a couple annoying bugs in Se-RC 1.03; when is the 1.0.4 release?</em></p><p>Se-RC 1.0.4 is planned for sometime towards the end of July 2010</p><p><em>I’ve heard rumours that 1.0.4 the to be the final release?</em></p><p>Yes. 1.0.4 is <em>planned</em> on being the final 1.x release</p><p><em>That’s crazy talk! I can’t use a .0 or ‘alpha’ release for my mission critical application</em></p><p>Actually, its not all <em>that</em> crazy — and needs a bit more explanation. Se2 is truly a merger of the two projects, in fact 2.0a1 was literally the Se code from the OpenQA repository and the WebDriver code its Google Code repository merged into a <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium>new one</a>. This meant that from the first release of the 2.x series, it has contained 100% of the 1.x code which means 100% backwards compatibility. Later releases in the 2.x series have been driven primarily by evolutions of the code that came from WebDriver, <em>not from Se 1.x</em>.</p><p><em>OK, so 100% of Se 1.x is in 2.x; I get that. But how are you making sure that fixes to one get into the other?</em></p><p>Here is another ‘secret’ — don’t tell anyone, but there hasn’t been any pure 1.x development since the merging of the codebases. Every 1.x release since the merger has really been a 2.x release — but all packaged up to make it look like a 1.x release. This is why observant people have noticed a log message that looks something like <em>11:09:37.507 INFO – v2.0 [a4], with Core v2.0 [a4]</em> when they start up their 1.x server.</p><p><em>So you’ve been releasing <em>alpha</em> code disguised as a stable release? Jerks!</em></p><p>Woah! Relax! Recall what I said above about it being backwards compatible by default. The ‘alpha’ tag is there because the API for the new code is still being developed and features flushed out. The 1.x code is however, still stable and still production quality.</p><p><em>Alright, I take back calling you folks jerks, but I really don’t like the alpha tag. When will it be out of ‘alpha’?</em></p><p>There is only one or two more features to implement (like handling alerts) in the WebDriver code and some cleanup before the betas start. But hope for a 2.0.0 final by the end of the year. And while we’re on the topic of ‘alpha’ vs. ‘beta’, this the team’s working definitions of each.</p><ul><li><em>Alpha</em> – APIs can, and likely will change. Possibly in dramatic ways.</li><li><em>Beta</em> – With the APIs set, make sure they work with the major browsers</li></ul><p><em>‘Major Browsers’ eh, what exactly does that mean?</em></p><p>Right now it means Firefox, Internet Explorer and at least one WebKit based one (Safari or Chrome)</p><p>In short… it is a requirement of Se2 that the server be backwards compatible with Se-RC 1.x and that has already been accomplished by building the code from a common source repository. This means that if you are using Se-RC, you can switch out the server for a 2.x one and have no impact on the execution of the scripts. <em>Plus</em> you can start to experiment with the new stuff that came over from WebDriver.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-5f44aeb0bdf64c330905b9a0b4987ea7>A Smattering of Selenium #20</h1><div class=lead>12 hours late, but I was driving draft horses all day so that’s my excuse and I’m sticking with it.</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Adam Goucher (<a href=https://twitter.com/adamgoucher>@adamgoucher</a>)</b> |

<time datetime=2010-07-15 class=text-body-secondary>Thursday, July 15, 2010</time></div><p>What’s new for Selenium this summer ? The GSoC of course !!!!</p><p>I’m Jérémy, a french engineer and I work at <a href=http://www.serli.com/>SERLI</a>, a services company based in France.<br>I’m working on Selenium since a year and this summer I’m mentoring Aleksejs for the GSoC 2010. I’m helped by <a href=http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/>David Burns</a> when I’m on vacation or offline. His experience is really useful to me, and David is involved on student supervising regularly.</p><p>Aleksejs comes from Latvia in Europe (yes I know you know but perhaps Geography wasn’t your favorite subject at school ;)). His work was initiated by Patrick and myself. We thought to a remote system that allows Selenium users to save and get remote test cases, directly with Selenium, without any other installations like SVN.</p><p>What’s better than record a test case with Selenium IDE and save it on your remote storage? what’s better than share your test cases with colleagues without any other installations, just by using Selenium IDE or a Selenium Remote Storage client?</p><p>For myself I don’t know what’s better 🙂</p><p>Aleksejs has already coded the server side of the remote storage mechanism with all the necessary unit tests. He has also created a web interface to use it directly through the browser. With his work, you can put, get and delete a test case, and you can also browse the directory where test cases are stored. His work has been done in Java, and he used JSON, for data representation for the communication protocol. This system is really simply to use, based on REST technology, you only have to call URLs with the good parameters.</p><p>The next step of his work is to create a Se-IDE plugin based on the API done by Adam (thanks to him). This part has to be done in less than a month and I think it’s a hard task, but it’s so cool to write your own plugin. In this case, Aleksejs will use JavaScript, AJAX and XUL technologies. It’s really good to learn a lot of technologies for its own culture, it’s so trainer.</p><p>I hope you’re enthousiastic to get this new feature, but wait until October, when the work will be finalized 🙂</p><p>Enjoy guys, Aleksejs, David and I are ready to discuss on it if you have any questions. And good luck with the end of this adventure Aleksejs.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-d1a6ec4e21a5112b0d439ccd8bec21d1>Selenium 2.0a5 Released</h1><div class=lead>I’m pleased to announce the release of Selenium 2.0a5, available for immediate download.</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Simon Stewart (<a href=https://twitter.com/shs96c>@shs96c</a>)</b> |

You can use them like this: <code>driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(15, TimeUnit.SECONDS)</code></li><li>A revamped Firefox driver.</li><li>More shared code between Selenium and WebDriver.</li><li>You can now pass firefox profiles to the remote webdriver (this includes extensions and proxy settings!)</li><li>Improved .Net bindings: lots of updates to help bring them more in-line with the Java equivalents.</li></ul><p>Waiting in the wings for release soon is an AndroidDriver, which opens up the world of testing webapps on Android devices through the Selenium WebDriver API.</p><p>If you’re a pythonista or rubyist, you’ve not been left out of this bonaza of new hotness. There have been regular updates for these languages, which can be installed via “easy_install -U selenium” or “gem install selenium-webdriver” depending on your language of choice.</p><p>Hopefully the next alpha will be the last before we plunge bravely into the betas. Exciting times are ahead!</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-80bd329c6c21d5b3737566ce0f75cfa5>A Smattering of Selenium #19</h1><div class=lead>I’ve got a full day of driving ahead of me to go to a client so this is the early-morning (for me) edition of the Smattering post.</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Adam Goucher (<a href=https://twitter.com/adamgoucher>@adamgoucher</a>)</b> |

<time datetime=2010-07-09 class=text-body-secondary>Friday, July 09, 2010</time></div><p>Its been around six months and three releases since I took the reins of Selenium-IDE. The fundamental change in that time has been the adoption of a plugin model like the fine folks over that Firebug. (We’re also self-hosting it which is big from a project internals perspective.)</p><p>Right now, you can add custom user-extensions and formatters, but in the very near future you will be able to add location strategies as well.</p><p>So what does the future look like for Se-IDE?</p><ul><li><em>1.0.8</em> – A whack of bug fixes, and maybe the location strategies via plugins</li><li><em>1.0.9</em> – If location strategies doesn’t get into 1.0.8, it will be here. And likely bug fixes.</li><li><em>1.0.10</em> – Remove UI-Element from Se-IDE and make it a plugin</li></ul><p>There is also work on reworking the internals of Se-IDE from a synchronous model to an asynchronous through Google Summer of Code. If that is successful and we decide to use it, that will trigger a bump to 1.1.0.</p><p>Timelines you ask? Well, when I took over Se-IDE the plan was to do it monthly. That was either naive or overly optimistic so they are starting to stretch a bit. 1.0.8 is going to stretch it some more too. Look for a beta of 1.0.8 towards the end of the month with a final version by mid-August.</p><p>I know you are likely wondering what cool, superdidooper features will you be seeing in Se-IDE over the next while? Ummm, well, actually none. At least not from the core Se-IDE. There will be significant pushback on any new ‘feature’ or change that adds something to Se-IDE. If you cannot accomplish your goal through a plugin, then I would consider than an omission in terms of the API.</p><p>Thats where we are from the maintainer perspective, but end-users also have sway over this as well to some degree. We’re now using the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list>Google Code Issue Tracker</a> for managing the project. If you bug is not there, there is a significantly smaller chance of it being addressed. And if an issue has a number of stars on it, that is also an indicator we should be looking at it.</p><p>Now to hack on locators…</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-7422daad7ef066d6903dcf4de7e60a2c>A Smattering of Selenium #18</h1><div class=lead>Not too much this week with various holidays around the world, but still managed to dig some things up.</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Adam Goucher (<a href=https://twitter.com/adamgoucher>@adamgoucher</a>)</b> |

<time datetime=2010-04-27 class=text-body-secondary>Tuesday, April 27, 2010</time></div><p>As you likely know by now, after years of stewardship Philippe has stepped down as maintainer of Selenium Grid and has named me the <a href=http://ph7spot.com/blog/new-selenium-grid-maintainer>new maintainer.</a> In this post, I hope to address the most immediate questions about what this means for the future of Selenium Grid.</p><h2 id=background>Background</h2><p>I realize many of you may not know who I am. I’ve been using Selenium in some capacity for close to five years now. I love working on open source software and do so primarily through my membership in the Apache Software Foundation and through <a href=http://github.com/nirvdrum/>my GitHub account</a>. I hang out on the #selenium channel with the handle “nirvdrum” and have a <a href=http://nirvdrum.com/>personal page</a> that includes some articles I’ve written and other things I’m involved with. Perhaps more importantly, I also rely on Selenium Grid for <a href=http://mogotest.com/>my latest start-up</a> so I’m very keen on seeing the project mature and evolve.</p><h2 id=project-resources>Project Resources</h2><p>The new canonical project repository on GitHub is the <a href=http://github.com/nirvdrum/selenium-grid/>nirvdrum fork</a>. However, within in the next month or so the project will be migrated from git and GitHub to subversion and the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/>Selenium project on Google Code</a>. As much as I personally prefer GitHub to Google Code, it makes the most sense from a community perspective for all Selenium projects to be hosted in the same location. The move will be made after Selenium Grid stabilizes a bit more. The <a href=/blog/2010/selenium-grid-1-0-6-released/>1.0.6 release</a> was the first step in that process, but there may be one or two more minor patch releases. After the move, I’ll try to maintain a synchronized mirror of the code on GitHub so those that prefer to develop patches with git can continue to do so.</p><p>The canonical issue tracker is the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list>Selenium issue tracker</a> on Google Code. We will not be using either JIRA or GitHub Issues. I’ll try to migrate what I can over to the new tracker, but if I miss anything, please re-open the issue over there.</p><h2 id=project-evolution>Project Evolution</h2><p>Selenium Grid currently only works with Selenium 1.x, and consequently the 1.x compatibility interface in Selenium 2. There is currently no support for WebDriver. However, I fully intend to steer the product in that direction, while maintaining support for existing Selenium Grid installations (i.e., based on Selenium 1.x).</p><p>Since the project is moving to Google Code, all of the existing Selenium committers will have the ability to commit to the codebase. This should make the project’s evolution a much more collaborative effort. I’ll kickstart the process and likely lead the development effort, but the role of maintainer will be diminished (in a positive way) by allowing the entire core team equal access to the project.</p><p>Others are welcome to chime as well. Selenium Grid development discussion will be taking place on the Selenium developers list. Please continue to use the Selenium users list for usage and support inquiries.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-f30ab42071624217688f6e904244f919>Selenium 2.0a3 Released</h1><div class=lead>Selenium 2.0a3 has been released.

<time datetime=2010-02-24 class=text-body-secondary>Wednesday, February 24, 2010</time></div><p>Hot off the heals of <a href=../selenium-1-0-2-release-firefox-3-6-and-snow-leopard-support/>1.0.2</a>,
we’re releasing Selenium Remote Control 1.0.3. You can download it now (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-remote-control-1.0.3.zip</code>).</p><p>There is no functional difference between this version and 1.0.2, other than it is packaged up a little nicer and we’ve clarified the relationship between selenium-server and the client drivers. That is: we are <strong>not</strong> releasing new client drivers with future 1.x releases. The reason is that we locked down the API in version 1.0.1 and so there is no need to push out the same code each time. As such, when you download 1.0.3, you’ll see all the client drivers are labeled version 1.0.1, which is expected.</p><p>This release also is zipped up in a way that is compatible with all operating systems. The 1.0.2 release had some reported issues on Windows that have been fixed.</p><p>Finally, we also had many requests from <a href=http://maven.apache.org/>Maven</a> users. While we no longer use Maven to build Selenium, we are including pom releases for both the standalone server (ie: selenium-server.jar) and the “coreless” server (ie: selenium-server-coreless.jar). We hope they will be in the central repository shortly.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-764f7d04d80f15bc729348aa43ae536b>Selenium 1.0.2 Released: Firefox 3.6 and Snow Leopard Support</h1><div class=lead>Today we’re happy to announce that Selenium Remote Control 1.0.2 has been released!</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Patrick Lightbody (<a href=https://twitter.com/plightbo>@plightbo</a>)</b> |
