<time datetime=2011-12-09 class=text-body-secondary>Friday, December 09, 2011</time></div><p>The community around Selenium is the thing that really makes the Selenium project special. Last year, we held the first official Selenium Conference in San Francisco, and it was both great fun and a huge success. It is therefore with great pleasure that we are announcing <a href=http://www.seleniumconf.org/>Selenium Conf ’12</a>! It’ll be taking place in <strong>London</strong> from the <strong>16th to the 18th April</strong>, and we’re really looking forward to seeing you all there!</p><p>If you’ve been following <a href=https://twitter.com/#!/seleniumconf>@seleniumconf</a> on Twitter, you probably already know that we have some <a href=http://seconf2012.eventbrite.com/>early bird tickets</a> available and the <a href=http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/>Call for Papers</a> is open. We’re looking for everything from lighting talks, through traditional presentations, to half-day long workshops on anything that uses Selenium in any way, including building on the Selenium WebDriver APIs (so talks about Watir would be welcome too!). It’ll be a chance to show off what you know and learn from the experts. If you get a quiet moment during the Christmas break, why not put <a href=http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/>forward a talk</a>? If you’re not a talker, but can help us with <a href=http://www.seleniumconf.org/sponsors/>sponsorship</a>, we’d love to hear from you too!</p><p>Just as last year, the workshops will be happening on the first day of the conference, but places are limited. We plan on running a total of four workshops across two tracks, meaning each workshop is half a day long; a fantastic opportunity to take a deep dive into a particular area of the project. The early bird tickets give you access to them, as well as the conference itself on the 17th and 18th.</p><p>The conference will consist of a main single track with selected speakers, with break out rooms being dedicated to an unconference, the contents of which will be decided by attendees. It’ll be your conference, help us make it brilliant 🙂</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-5a918926ce3369e2f30acd8667143fe9>A Smattering of Selenium #71</h1><div class=lead>Looking like there might also be one later in the week too…</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Adam Goucher (<a href=https://twitter.com/adamgoucher>@adamgoucher</a>)</b> |

Don’t worry: 2.4 and 2.5 were released on time and without muss or fuss. 2.6, on the other hand has been almost three weeks brewing.</p><p>Selenium 2.6 introduces a raft of improvements and stability fixes. Kristian Rosenvold has been working wonders on <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2>Grid 2.0</a>, addressing many reported issues and cleaning up the implementation. In the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=14">finest tradition of the project</a>, I now <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2475">owe him a dinner</a> for his hard work. Thank you, Kristian!</p><p>For those of you not using Grid, as well as the normal suite of bug fixes, Selenium 2.6 now supports all versions of Firefox from 3.0 up to 7. For those of you using Java, there is an ExpectedConditions (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/ExpectedConditions.html) class that supplies many useful criteria when using the [Wait](http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/Wait.html</code>) and WebDriverWait (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/WebDriverWait.html</code>) classes. The packaged version of the <a href=http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/operadriver/>OperaDriver</a> has also been bumped to 0.7.2, which works hand-in-hand with Opera 11.5 and above.</p><p>We’ve also spent a considerable amount of time and effort working out the kinks in the Advanced User Interactions API (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/interactions/package-frame.html</code>).

The aim is for these updates to be small and manageable, incrementally addressing issues and problems raised by you. Selenium 2.1, which is <a href=http://seleniumhq.org/download/>launched today</a>, marks the first of these regular, small releases.</p><p><a href=http://seleniumhq.org/download/>Selenium 2.1</a> is largely focused on improving Grid with a host of minor improvements including better tracking of “orphaned” browser instances. There are also some bug fixes in the Firefox and IE WebDrivers, particularly when dealing with elements that are <em>just</em> off screen, and in making the Selenium RC emulation in the Java bindings more robust when confronted with pages that haven’t started loading.</p><p>As you can see, this is a “bite size” release, but we’d love to know: would you prefer these small, swift releases or larger ones?

<time datetime=2011-07-08 class=text-body-secondary>Friday, July 08, 2011</time></div><p>We are very, very pleased to announce the <a href=http://seleniumhq.org/download/>release of Selenium 2.0</a>. If you’ve been waiting for a stable release since 1.0.3, now’s the chance to update. And if you do, what will you find?</p><p>For users of Selenium 1, this is a drop-in replacement. You’ll find support for modern browsers such as <a href=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/>Firefox 5</a> and <a href=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/internet-explorer/products/ie/home>IE 9</a>, as well as a wealth of bug fixes and stability improvements. That’s one reason to update, but what other reasons are there?</p><p>The big feature of this release — and the reason for the new version number — are the new WebDriver APIs for <a href=http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium>Python</a>, <a href=http://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver>Ruby</a>, <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list>Java and C#</a>. These have been in development for over four years, and are already widely used, trusted and depended on. The WebDriver APIs have been written by developers familiar with each language, so they feel like they belong there. We’re very proud of them, and hope you enjoy using them.</p><p>Support for WebDriver is also baked into <a href=http://www.opera.com/>Opera</a> and <a href=http://www.google.com/chrome>Chrome</a>, and we’re working closely with <a href=http://www.mozilla.org/>Mozilla</a> to ensure that their browsers also support it. Looking to the future, WebDriver also works on both Android and iPhone, allowing you to test your sites on the next wave of the Web.</p><p>As well as support by the browser vendors, WebDriver also provides excellent emulation of user inputs using something we call “native events”. Normal browser automation frameworks, including older versions of Selenium, simulate user interactions via the Javascript engine of the browser. This approach is error prone as each browser has its own quirks. “Native events” are fired at the OS level instead, avoiding a large amount of browser-specific complexity.</p><p>Advanced Selenium users will be pleased to hear that the standalone selenium server also includes support for distributed testing via <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2>Selenium Grid</a>. This new Grid implementation supports testing using both the original Selenium API and WebDriver, and has been developed as a collaboration between the current Grid maintainer and an engineer from eBay.</p><p>We’re working hard to ensure that Selenium IDE also supports all these new features and APIs. IDE version 1.1.0 should be released next week, with support for exporting to the four main languages supported by WebDriver. Please keep an eye on this blog for announcements! There will also be follow up posts, exploring and explaining each of the new features, and providing you with more information.</p><p>Of course, Selenium 2.0 is a major milestone, but we’re not done yet. This release marks the point where we expect our APIs to change very little from now on and where we believe it’s a solid release. Like all software, it has niggles and bugs, and we’ll be focusing on addressing these as your feedback comes in.</p><p>As a personal note, I’d like to say thank you to each of the many people that have worked so hard to make this the best Selenium version yet. Not only the developers but also the team working on making our <a href=http://seleniumhq.org/docs/>documentation</a> clear and easy to read, everyone who’s taken the time to <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list>report bugs</a>, and also to you; our <a href=https://groups.google.com/group/webdriver>users</a> and <a href=https://groups.google.com/group/selenium-users>community</a>. The project is great fun to work on, and you’re the reason for that. Thank you!</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-784b1924e7831c6e402ed22f5df21443>New ChromeDriver</h1><div class=lead>The ChromeDriver is composed of two major pieces.</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Simon Stewart (<a href=https://twitter.com/shs96c>@shs96c</a>)</b> |

Use WebElement.getAttribute(“value”) (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#getAttribute(java.lang.String)</code>) instead.</li><li>After some debate in the team, WebElement.setSelected (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#setSelected()</code>) and “<a href=http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#toggle()>WebElement.toggle</a>” have been deprecated. They will be removed in the final release.</li><li>Thanks to the hard work of Mozilla engineers, we now offer Firefox 5 support.</li><li>The <a href=http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/operadriver/>Opera driver</a>, developed by the lovely chaps at Opera Software, is bundled with this release.</li><li>Improvements in the way that mouse interactions are simulated, particularly when elements are outside the visible area of the page.</li></ul><p>As with almost all releases, there are still some issues left to resolve, but we’re working hard to make Selenium 2.0 as good as it can be.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-7508529679565c8b419043440b355bd2>A Smattering of Selenium #51</h1><div class=lead>Two big releases last week&mldr;</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Adam Goucher (<a href=https://twitter.com/adamgoucher>@adamgoucher</a>)</b> |

<time datetime=2011-06-01 class=text-body-secondary>Wednesday, June 01, 2011</time></div><p>We’re very happy to announce the first Release Candidate for Selenium 2, available for Java, C#, Ruby and Python. The API has been stabilised and the functionality needed for the final 2.0 release is mostly in. We’re going to be working hard to get there as soon as possible, but now’s the perfect time to test the waters and provide us with any feedback you may have! <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list>Grab the downloads from the site</a>!</p><p>Highlights:</p><ul><li><a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2>Grid 2</a>: A major feature of this release is Grid 2, an implementation of the Selenium Grid that supports WebDriver’s wire protocol, allowing tests using Selenium WebDriver to be distributed through it. There are some <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2>docs to help you get started</a> on the wiki.</li><li>New <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver>ChromeDriver</a>: Following a complete rewrite of the ChromeDriver, Selenium 2 is now supported natively by the Chrome browser itself. In order to use this, you must download the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list>chromedriver executable</a> from the Selenium project site.</li><li><a href=http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/operadriver/>OperaDriver</a> support: We’ve bundled the most excellent OperaDriver into the release to make it easy to get started testing with <a href=http://www.opera.com/browser/>Opera</a>.</li><li>Support for native events in Firefox 4.</li><li><a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/AdvancedUserInteractions>Advanced User Interactions</a>: An API that allows you to model complex user interactions, such as clicking on an element, holding the shift key, clicking on three more, and then dragging the four elements to a final destination. The entry point to this API is the Actions (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/interactions/Actions.html</code>) class.</li></ul><p>We’ve also deleted all methods that were deprecated in 2.0b3 and have marked a number of methods and classes (notably RenderedWebElement (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/RenderedWebElement.html</code>) and WebElement.getValue (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#getValue()</code>)) deprecated. These will be deleted in the next release.</p><p>Known issues:</p><ul><li>Native events on Linux may not work properly on tests that include alerts and prompts.</li><li>Mouse actions using the Advanced User Interactions API may not work properly for elements that have to be scrolled into view.</li></ul><p>We plan on making our releases more frequent in the run up to 2.0final and polish off the bugs and issues. Stay tuned! This is going to be fun 🙂</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-27d94d4562b7a6e45bb50bfc124719af>Selenium IDE 1.0.11 – Now with Firefox 4 Support!</h1><div class=lead>We know that you have been waiting eagerly for this release and you have to wait no more.</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Samit Badle (<a href=https://twitter.com/samitbadle>@samitbadle</a>)</b> |

<time datetime=2011-02-15 class=text-body-secondary>Tuesday, February 15, 2011</time></div><p>We’ve just released Selenium 2.0b2. If you’re the impatient sort who loves to have the latest and greatest, head over to the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list>download site</a> and get it while it’s hot. If you’re a Python user, then all you need to do is a simple “pip install -U selenium”. Ruby users can, as ever, simply run “gem install selenium-webdriver”. Maven users need to wait just a little bit longer: we’re going to be checking the release in ASAP.</p><p>Between beta 1 and beta 2, we held a week-long Bug Bash, during which we closed a significant number of bugs. From a user’s perspective, other highlights include:</p><ul><li>A more stable, capable iPhone driver.</li><li>Updated <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/detail?name=selenium-server-2.0b2.zip&can=2&q=">Android driver</a>.</li><li>Improved python bindings for Selenium WebDriver. The namespace is now “selenium.webdriver”</li><li>Added Selenium.getCssCount (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/Selenium.html#getCssCount(java.lang.String)</code>) to mirror “Selenium.getXpathCount”</li><li>WebElement.getText() (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#getText()</code>) performs more consistently across different browsers.</li><li>Mono users can use the .Net bindings</li><li>Continued to improve the WebDriverBackedSelenium (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebDriverBackedSelenium.html</code>). If you’re looking to migrate from Selenium 1 to Selenium 2, and want to take your time, this is a useful stepping stone.</li><li>Reworked the Advanced User Interactions APIs. The big change is that the WebDriver APIs no longer rely on classes from the AWT.</li><li>.Net users now have more support classes, to make writing tests less tiresome.</li><li>The remote webdriver makes better use of sockets, which improves stability and scalability on Windows.</li><li>Started to add support for driving multiple IE instances. This is considered experimental, but we’d love to hear it’s working for you!</li></ul><p>If you’re interested in the guts of Selenium 2 and how it worked, then you might find these interesting:</p><ul><li>Continued reworking the IE and iPhone drivers to use the Automation Atoms.</li><li>Reworked the structure of the source tree to be more language focused.</li><li>We have the skeleton of a webdriver-backed selenium for Python.</li></ul><p>As you can see, this is a big release. Beta 3 should be out a lot more quickly, and will be focusing on improving support for IE 9 and Firefox 4. Over the course of the 2.0b3 development, we shall also be removing as many deprecated methods as possible, so be sure to remove deprecation warnings from your builds when using 2.0b2!</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-0242f7489e0dd9eb5a17530ed27a4310>A Smattering of Selenium #41</h1><div class=lead>There isn’t an official announcement anywhere (yet) but Selenium 2.0b2 was released a couple hours ago.</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Adam Goucher (<a href=https://twitter.com/adamgoucher>@adamgoucher</a>)</b> |

I’m very pleased to announce that as of Friday, 21st January, our application was approved. We’re now under the aegis of the SFC.</p><p>From most people’s perspective, this won’t make much difference: you’ll still be able to view the documentation and download the latest versions of Selenium from <a href=http://seleniumhq.org>Selenium HQ</a>. Development will continue to use Google Code’s (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/</code>) code hosting and issue tracking. We are now, however, part of a formal non-profit organization, which means that a number of issues, such as how to handle revenues from adverts on our sites, become clearer and more transparent.</p><p>There are more details about what this means in the <a href=http://sfconservancy.org/news/2011/feb/02/selenium-joins/ title="Selenium Joins the Software Freedom Conservancy">SFC’s announcement</a> and their list of <a href=http://sfconservancy.org/members/services/ title="SFC Member Project Services">membership benefits</a>. The bottom line is that this is a major milestone in Selenium’s growth and ensures that as we continue to grow our user base and introduce new features and projects, we’ll have strong support and backing from a well-respected Open Source organization.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-60334e15d1e787137698f1ee96722c45>A Smattering of Selenium #39</h1><div class=lead>Hey look!

<time datetime=2011-01-21 class=text-body-secondary>Friday, January 21, 2011</time></div><p>When the Selenium (<code>http://selenium.googlecode.com/</code>) and WebDriver projects merged, all those moons ago, we moved the infrastructure from something we hosted to Google Code. One reason for doing this was to make it easier for people to file bugs and feature requests. And it looks like people have been filing a <em>lot</em> of bugs and feature requests.</p><p>In the run up for the 2.0b2 release, we’ll be running a Bug Bash. This will run from the 24th January all the way to the end of the 30th January. The aim will be to focus on clearing our bug list as much as possible, so that beta2 will be the best release of Selenium yet. We will, of course, be recognizing people who squash the most bugs here on the blog, and we’re hunting out goodies to mail to the top bug bashers once the week is over.</p><p>If you’d like to get involved, it’s easy:</p><ol><li><a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/checkout>Check out</a> the source code</li><li>Find a bug you’d like to squash in the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list>issue tracker</a></li><li>Fix it, attaching your patch to the issue</li></ol><p>That’s it. Easy! For help, and to ask questions of the core development team, please hop on to the <a href=http://seleniumhq.org/support/>IRC channel</a> or email the <a href=http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-developers>selenium-developers</a> group.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> The Bug Bash is now complete. All we have to do is count up the scores!</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-a124fb5037520390977b14120b42d107>A Smattering of Selenium #37B</h1><div class=lead>Let’s see how many announcements there were that didn’t get pushed out in a timely manner today shall we?</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Adam Goucher (<a href=https://twitter.com/adamgoucher>@adamgoucher</a>)</b> |
