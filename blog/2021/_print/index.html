<time datetime=2021-12-03 class=text-body-secondary>Friday, December 03, 2021</time></div><p>A while ago, we started to make the Selenium <a href=/documentation/>documentation</a> available in more
languages. This, in an effort to offer a more inclusive environment for Selenium users who do
not have English as their mother tongue.</p><p>This effort grew organically, and we got many pull requests adding content for different
languages. Over time, some translations got to a very good state, and others didn&rsquo;t get much
attention. This brought the situation where 9 different languages are available in the
documentation, but only a few add value to the readers.</p><p>To understand which languages are getting visits, we started using
<a href=https://plausible.io>Plausible</a>. After a few weeks, we combined the information collected
by the analytics tool with the translated percentage per language, and we got the following:</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the number of visitors on the landing page for a given translation in the past 2 weeks,
and the percent of documentation pages translated:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Language</th><th>Visitors</th><th>Translated</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ja</td><td>1,700</td><td>86%</td></tr><tr><td>zh-cn</td><td>1,500</td><td>86%</td></tr><tr><td>es</td><td>409</td><td>42%</td></tr><tr><td>fr</td><td>203</td><td>31%</td></tr><tr><td>pt-br</td><td>189</td><td>87%</td></tr><tr><td>de</td><td>88</td><td>65%</td></tr><tr><td>ko</td><td>79</td><td>68%</td></tr><tr><td>nl</td><td>22</td><td>6%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This shows that the most used languages (aside from English) are Japanese and Chinese, and that
the language that has translated most of the content is Portuguese.</p><p>Based on this data, we decided to create a new role in the Selenium project:
<a href=/project/structure/#docs_site_translators>translators</a>. This role will help the project

What happens next?</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Simon Stewart (<a href=https://twitter.com/shs96c>@shs96c</a>)</b> |
<time datetime=2021-10-27 class=text-body-secondary>Wednesday, October 27, 2021</time></div><p>The short version is that I&rsquo;m stepping down as the Selenium project
lead, and will concentrating on pushing WebDriver Bidi
forwards. Fortunately, the <a href=/project/structure/#tlc>Selenium TLC</a> have already been
steering the project for a while now, so it&rsquo;s in excellent hands. With
Selenium 4 now shipped, the project has a new energy and enthusiasm
about it. The future is bright, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing what
it holds.</p><p>The longer version? Well, that&rsquo;s more personal. Let me start at the
beginning&mldr;.</p><p>On the 3rd January, 2007 I pushed the <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/commit/29393a759063a0ea7a2d05c9592d687c4b6438a9>initial commit</a> of
&ldquo;WebDriver&rdquo; to a public repo. I helped with the Selenium 1.0 release,
and at the same time made sure that WebDriver emulated the original
Selenium RC APIs (in code that lives on to this day). In 2009, <a href=https://twitter.com/hugs>Jason
Huggins</a> and I <a href=https://youtu.be/Vlz-WmcrBL8>merged the Selenium and WebDriver
projects</a>, and I took over the leadership of the
project. I&rsquo;ve been the lead for every version of Selenium since then,
often being the person who tagged each release in source control, all
the way up to the recent Selenium 4 release.</p><p>By the numbers, that&rsquo;s</p><ul><li>14 years of WebDriver</li><li>12 years of Selenium for me<ul><li>Though the first Selenium commits were in 2004</li></ul></li><li>1 <a href=https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-gb/insights/blog/happy-10th-birthday-selenium>10 year birthday celebration</a></li><li>Approximately 130 Selenium releases.</li><li>I&rsquo;ve landed just over 5100 commits<ul><li>Which is about 20% of all the changes made to Selenium over the
years.</li></ul></li><li>3 different source control systems</li><li>5 build systems</li><li>14 Selenium conferences</li><li>696 different people contributing to the project.</li></ul><p>In a way, I blame Michael C for this. He and I worked together at
ThoughtWorks in Australia, and had been working with
<a href=http://httpunit.sourceforge.net>HttpUnit</a>. My assertion was that its API was fine. His was
that it should be more <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming>Object-Oriented</a>. To explore the idea, I
started writing an OO wrapper around HttpUnit, and (of course!)
Michael was right.</p><p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s <a href=https://github.com/joewalnes>Joe Walnes</a> who I should be talking
about. At about the same, he&rsquo;d been exploring a similar kind of
design, but where my API had a <code>Browser</code>, his had the far better
sounding <code>WebDriver</code>, and he was generous enough to allow me to use
the same name in my next iteration of the idea.</p><p>Or, perhaps, it&rsquo;s <a href=https://paulhammant.com>Paul Hammant</a> and <a href=https://www.thoughtworks.com>ThoughtWorks</a>. Paul was the
one who suggested Open Sourcing what was then &ldquo;WebDriver&rdquo; under the
Apache 2 license, and ThoughtWorks supported the decision to make the
code available to the world.</p><p>In any case, on that day in 2007, I was sitting on the sofa with a
glass of red wine, creating the project on <a href=https://code.google.com/archive/>Google Code</a>,
and thinking (if I was thinking deeply at all) that it&rsquo;d be nice to
get the code out there, and in six months it&rsquo;ll probably be
over. There was absolutely no way I could dream that the project would
grow far beyond me, emerging from the <a href=https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2019/february/the-cambrian-explosion-was-far-shorter-than-thought.html>Cambrian explosion</a>
of the early days of web testing to become first an industry-wide de
facto standard, and then, through the work done in the W3C, an <a href=https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/>actual
standard</a>. It&rsquo;s the only browser automation API that all the
browser vendors support.</p><p>During these past 14 years, Selenium has been one of the constants of
my life. I joke sometimes that I&rsquo;ve known it longer than my wife and
my son, but is it a joke if it&rsquo;s true?</p><p>Why spend that much time and effort on Open Source? On something that
you give away for free? Because it&rsquo;s just been so incredibly
rewarding. I&rsquo;ve had a chance to meet people from all over the globe,
work with amazing people from a range of companies I&rsquo;d never have a
chance of working with normally, learn and practice skills I wouldn&rsquo;t
have had a chance to exercise, and to write code that makes people&rsquo;s
lives just a little bit easier.</p><p>Most importantly, Selenium has been the way that I&rsquo;ve met some of the
best friends I have in my life. I&rsquo;ve been very lucky.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also been lucky to have met and been part of the Selenium
community. The conferences and meetups have been a fantastic way to
hear about how people are using the tool, and I am constantly
impressed by how inventive and thoughtful people can be. The
conversations I&rsquo;ve had at those events have changed how I think about
all sorts of things, and not just code. The IRC and Slack channels are
vibrant and interesting places to be. There are folks who are there
regularly who I&rsquo;ve never met in person, but who I feel I could count
as friends.</p><p>Who knew that Open Source could be the source of so much that makes a
life bright?</p><p>But today, I&rsquo;m stepping down as the project lead, and will be away
from the project until summer, though (in the true spirit of this
project), I’m not sure which year.</p><p>Why, if all I said above is true, am I stepping down?</p><p>The major reason is that the things I like to do, and that I&rsquo;m good
at, are not the things that the project needs right now. It would be
hubris to believe that no-one else could do as good a job,
particularly when I know how amazing so many people on the project
are.</p><p>The other reason is that I&rsquo;m tired. For the past 14 years, much of my
free time, as well as hours within work, has been spent working on
Selenium. There are other projects and interests I&rsquo;d like to pour some
energy into (just ask me how my Turkish lessons are going!)</p><p>In my absence, the project&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=/project/structure/#tlc>Technical Leadership Committee</a>&rdquo;
will continue to be setting the direction of the project. I&rsquo;ve been
listening to the discussions about where the project can go: it&rsquo;s
going to be brilliant.</p><p>That is, while I&rsquo;m stepping down, the rest of the TLC will be stepping
up. They&rsquo;ve already been running the project for a while. They’ll
continue the work we’ve started and carry it forwards and upwards. If
you&rsquo;re reading this, and want to get involved, step in and <a href=/support/#ChatRoom>join the
fun</a>. Now&rsquo;s the perfect time.</p><p>When I took over as lead of the Selenium project, Paul joked that he
had thrown me the keys and run in the opposite direction. I guess it’s
my turn to do that now!</p><p>Before finishing, I&rsquo;d just like to say a heartfelt &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to
everyone who&rsquo;s been involved in the Selenium project. To everyone
who&rsquo;s contributed in some way, or used the code we&rsquo;ve written, thank
you. To everyone who&rsquo;s filed a bug, thank you too. To all the people
who I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of so many conversations with, that I would
never have met without Selenium, thank you. To my family, who’ve
supported me and understood with endless patience that Selenium is a
part of our lives, thank you. And to my friends on the project, an
extra meaningful thank you.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t be here, but I won&rsquo;t be far. See you all soon.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-0fb02d542457cb306551fe9dabb718f9>A Tour of 4: New Commands</h1><div class=lead>There&rsquo;s more to Selenium 4 than just the server</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Simon Stewart (<a href=https://twitter.com/shs96c>@shs96c</a>)</b> |
<time datetime=2021-10-13 class=text-body-secondary>Wednesday, October 13, 2021</time></div><p>Before we ship Selenium 4, I thought it would be nice to introduce
some of the new features in-depth. Of course, all of the features
we&rsquo;re covering are in the main <a href=/documentation/webdriver/>WebDriver documentation</a>, so if
you&rsquo;re not one for reading blog posts, then feel free to dive in
there!</p><p>You may well be familiar with how to start a Selenium server: you just
do something like <code>java -jar selenium-server-4.0.0.jar standalone</code> and
away you go! But with Selenium 4, there are some more things you can
do with this jar.</p><p>Least obviously, the server jar is an exectuable on its own. If you&rsquo;re
using Linux or macOS, and have Java installed, you can make the jar
executable (eg. <code>chmod 755 selenium-server-4.0.0.jar</code>), rename it to
something like <code>selenium</code> and put it on your <code>$PATH</code>. That way, rather
than writing <code>java -jar ...</code> you can simply run <code>selenium</code>.</p><p>Now you&rsquo;ve done that, if you run <code>selenium</code> with <code>selenium --help</code>
you&rsquo;ll get a handy list of the available sub-commands you can
execute. There are the old favourites, such as <code>standalone</code> (for
starting a standalone selenium server), and <code>hub</code> and <code>node</code> (for
starting a Selenium <a href=/documentation/grid/setting_up_your_own_grid/#hub-and-node>Hub and Node</a> setup), but there are
other interesting commands that are new to Selenium 4.</p><p>The first of these is <code>info</code>. We&rsquo;ve added this to provide easy to find
and access documentation on common tasks when using the selenium
server. If you run <code>selenium info</code> on its own, you&rsquo;ll see something
like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#000>Info</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#ce5c00;font-weight:700>====</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>You can find out more about topics concerning Selenium Grid by running the
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#4e9a06>&#34;info&#34;</span> <span style=color:#204a87>command</span> followed by: 
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>

</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>* sessionmap - Help on different types of sessionmap and how to start them.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Each topic will give you enough information to <span style=color:#204a87>help</span> you get started, and contains
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>some pointers on our site to provide more <span style=color:#204a87>complete</span> information. 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To get more information on a particular topic, just add the name of
the topic, for example <code>selenium info security</code>. The hope is that this
will make it less daunting to deal with Selenium, and give you a great
place to get started with some of the more complicated topics around
running a Selenium Grid.</p><p>Although it&rsquo;s incredibly flexible, the <code>selenium</code> command offers a
daunting list of command line flags. How are you supposed to remember
them all? You&rsquo;re not! Instead, let <code>selenium completion</code> take the
strain for you. If you&rsquo;re a zsh user, then just <code>source &lt;(selenium completion zsh)</code>, and now you have tab completion for the
sub-commands, as well as for all the flags, including examples of how
to use them.</p><p>And, finally, there are some hidden flags. We hid them because they
can be a little bit confusing to use or understand what they&rsquo;re meant
to do, but one that can be very useful when debugging how your Grid is
configured is the <code>--dump-config</code> flag. When run with a server command
such as <code>standalone</code> or <code>hub</code>, it will dump the configuration options
used by the Grid as a JSON blob. This can be helpful for tracking down
subtle issues with configurations, especially when using environment
properties for configuration.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-bb7a2f33ec36e9aeb8c78437b9ec5a64>Announcing Selenium 4</h1><div class=lead>Selenium 4.0.0 is released! Get it while it&rsquo;s hot!</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Simon Stewart (<a href=https://twitter.com/shs96c>@shs96c</a>)</b> |
<time datetime=2021-10-13 class=text-body-secondary>Wednesday, October 13, 2021</time></div><p>It’s with very great pleasure that <strong>we are announcing the release of
Selenium 4</strong>. This is available for Java, .Net, Python, Ruby, and
Javascript. You can download it from your favourite package manager or
right <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases/tag/selenium-4.0.0>from GitHub</a>!</p><p>If you’re already a Selenium user, this update should be as easy as
just changing your dependency from 3.x to 4.0.0. We’ve worked hard to
ensure that this is a “drop-in” upgrade, having focused on keeping the
public APIs as stable as possible.</p><p>Of course, we’ve made changes, so if you relied on code that was
marked as internal to Selenium, or that was deprecated, you might
experience some hiccups. Please <a href=/documentation/getting_started/how_to_upgrade_to_selenium_4/>check our documentation</a> for
advice on how to deal with each of the common problems we’re aware of.</p><p>But there’s more to Selenium 4 than just being a stable release of
what was there before! It brings a whole host of new and exciting
features that we hope will make your tests more fun to write, and more
stable when you run them. Let’s take a look at some of them!</p><p>We’ve introduced “<a href=/documentation/webdriver/locating_elements/#relative-locators>relative locators</a>”. These allow you to specify
where on the page an element can be found using language that people
use too; things like “above that element”, or “to the right of this
other element”. This will hopefully provide you all with a tool to
fight against incredibly complex locators, making your tests read a
little more clearly, and being more resilient to changes in the page’s
DOM. We’re not the first ones to come up with this idea &ndash; that honour
belongs to <a href=https://www.sahipro.com>Sahi</a> &ndash; but if you’ve not used them before, we hope
you like them!</p><p>If you’re using <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/>Firefox</a> or a browser that is derived from
<a href=https://www.chromium.org/Home>Chromium</a>, we’ve added a slew of new capabilities
too. These include ways of handling <a href=/documentation/webdriver/bidi/cdp/network/#basic-authentication>“basic” and “digest”
authentication</a>, Network Interception (<a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418>Are you an HTTP
418?</a>), and also performing commonly requested tasks, like
waiting for a <a href=/documentation/webdriver/bidi/cdp/bidi_api/#mutation-observation>change in the DOM</a>, or providing a way to
look at <a href=/documentation/webdriver/bidi/cdp/bidi_api/#javascript-exceptions>Javascript errors</a>.</p><p>We’ve added these new features in a way that fits in with our existing
APIs. There’s no need to rewrite your tests: just use the new features
when it feels right to you.</p><p>We have also rebuilt the <a href=/documentation/grid/>Selenium Grid</a>, taking lessons from
successful projects such as <a href=https://opensource.zalando.com/zalenium/>Zalenium</a> and
<a href=https://aerokube.com/selenoid/latest/>Selenoid</a> to enhance the capabilities. This new Grid runs
just as well as a single process, running on a single machine, as it
does in the traditional “hub and node” configuration, but it also
supports a fully-distributed mode, for use in modern infrastructure
running Kubernetes. It has better security baked-in, because we know
that securing a Grid can be a difficult task. And at all of these
scales and sizes, all the new features we’ve added to the language
bindings will work as expected.</p><p>The Grid can also manage Docker containers on your local machine,
pulling images such as the <a href=https://hub.docker.com/u/selenium>standalone firefox server</a> so your
infrastructure maintenance becomes just a little bit less taxing.</p><p>Finally, the Grid is easier to manage. We’ve revamped the UI, placing
it on top of a GraphQL model that anyone is free to query and make use
of to create their own visualisations or monitors of the Grid. If
you’d like to peek into a running session, there are live VNC previews
you can open and interact with, providing even better insight into
what’s been going on. And if you want even more information, we’ve
integrated support for <a href=https://opentelemetry.io>OpenTelemetry</a> into the Grid, so now you
can find out exactly what’s happening, where, and when.</p><p>I know it’s a cliche to say that it’s a “very great pleasure”, but,
being honest with you, it genuinely is. Working on this new version of
Selenium has been a chance to work with some amazing engineers, and to
be part of a vibrant and energetic community. It’s been a lot of fun
to write this code, with these people, and it feels right to say
“thank you” to as many of them as possible here. So, without waiting
any longer&mldr;.</p><p>We would like to thank all of our users who have helped Selenium be
successful over the years. Without you we wouldn’t be where we are
today. We would also like to thank all the contributors who have
submitted <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pulls>Pull Requests</a>, your contributions make Selenium better. For
everyone who’s taken the time to file an issue, and to let us know
where there’s been a problem: thank you. We only have a chance to
improve when we know that there’s something that needs work!</p><p>And finally, thank you to all the Selenium Committers,
<a href=https://www.browserstack.com/>BrowserStack</a>, <a href=https://saucelabs.com>Sauce Labs</a>, and our
<a href=https://www.selenium.dev/sponsors/>Selenium-Level sponsors</a> for getting this release ready for
our users.</p><p><strong>We hope you enjoy Selenium 4, and we can’t wait to see what you do
with it!</strong></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-84646027c054d153e71a0f23e0b8009c>A Tour of 4: Authentication</h1><div class=lead>Introducing how Selenium 4 handles authentication</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Simon Stewart (<a href=https://twitter.com/shs96c>@shs96c</a>)</b> |

some of the new features in-depth. Of course, all of the features
we&rsquo;re covering are in the main <a href=/documentation/webdriver/>WebDriver documentation</a>, so if
you&rsquo;re not one for reading blog posts, then feel free to dive in
there!</p><p>The first thing I&rsquo;d like to introduce you to is Selenium 4&rsquo;s new-found
ability to authenticate to websites. We&rsquo;ve always been able to handle
&ldquo;form-based&rdquo; authentication, where a login page has some <code>INPUT</code>
elements that you need to enter the user name and password, but
handling sites that use <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication>basic or digest
authentication</a> has always been harder. When using
Selenium 3, the advice has been to get the login cookie and set it on
your session before accessing the site, but you can now just call a
<code>register</code> method to add a user name and password (or, in the future,
other kinds of authentication credentials)</p><p>In short, in Selenium 4, the process has become less
complicated. Perhaps an example will help?</p><ul class="nav nav-tabs" id=tabs-0 role=tablist><li class=nav-item><button class="nav-link active" id=tabs-00-00-tab data-bs-toggle=tab data-bs-target=#tabs-00-00 role=tab data-td-tp-persist=java aria-controls=tabs-00-00 aria-selected=true>

<time datetime=2021-10-02 class=text-body-secondary>Saturday, October 02, 2021</time></div><p>We&rsquo;ve listeneed and responded to the feedback from the first release
candidate of Selenium 4, and we&rsquo;re now happy to announce the second
release candidate of Selenium 4. This is shipping for .Net, Java,
Python, Ruby, and Javascript, and it&rsquo;s available from all the popular
package managers. Go! Try it out!</p><p>Unless we encounter a very serious issue or bug, this is likely to be
the last release before we push Selenium 4.0.0 itself. What does this
mean for you? It&rsquo;s your last chance to try it on for size and let us
know if there are any problems.</p><p>In this release, we&rsquo;ve fixed a nasty issue where closing the first
window would cause CDP-related features to break, and have landed a
few other cleanups and fixes.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re a Firefox user, please make sure you&rsquo;re using the very
latest version of the <a href=https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases>geckodriver</a> If you don&rsquo;t, there may be
problems starting sessions as we rely on new features that are
included in this new geckodriver release.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re new Selenium 4, then you may want to read this <a href=/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-new-tricks/>blog
post</a>, which explains more, but you might want to have a look at:</p><ul><li>Relative locators, which provide a way of finding elements by
where they are in relation to one another (like &ldquo;above&rdquo;, or &ldquo;to
the right of&rdquo;)</li><li>Authentication on websites using basic or digest authentication</li><li>Network interception, which provides an easy easy way to capture
and modify HTTP traffic from the browser, as well as making it
possible to get HTTP status codes.</li></ul><p>Thank you to everyone in the community who&rsquo;s given us so much helpful
and thoughtful feedback on the first release candidate. We really hope
that you enjoy this release candidate too!</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Selenium?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Selenium</a> 4 RC 2 has been tagged!

has been the central place where we have been able to upload all binaries created for each
Selenium release, and the place where the Selenium community can download them from. To do so,
all people needed to do was visit our <a href=https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/>downloads</a> page,
find the release, and download from there!</p><p>The Selenium project hosts its source code on GitHub, and people who are familiar with GitHub
know that they can go to the <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases>&ldquo;release&rdquo;</a> page
there to find any downloads for each release of a project.</p><p>Rather than hosting the downloads in two places, the Selenium project has decided to host
everything on GitHub. We&rsquo;ll still have links from the download page, but rather than pointing
to Google Storage, these will now point to the downloads for each corresponding release tagged
on GitHub.</p><p>All past releases will be available both in Google Storage and GitHub releases, but new ones
will only be present in GitHub releases.</p><p>If you are a watcher of the Selenium <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium>repo</a>, please note
that there will be some noise in your inboxes. We need to create releases for old tags in order
to upload the binaries to the release (as is the way GitHub releases work), and we expect to
complete this in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>If you have any questions or comments, please reach out through any of all the available options

and a few hacks in between</p><p>I’ve found <a href=https://www.docsy.dev/>https://www.docsy.dev/</a> a good alternative since it offers a good theme that can contain both things in one</p><p><em><em><strong>9:19</strong></em></em></p><p>this requires to recreate our website using the docsy theme, this part is around 60% done
then we need to migrate the existing docs into the new theme</p><p><em><em><strong>9:20</strong></em></em></p><p>migrating the docs could be done as a task of copying and pasting or we could see it as a chance to reestructure and organise the existing content, and adding a few things more</p><p><em><em><strong>9:21</strong></em></em></p><p>if we want to reestructure, it would be nice to see proposals (like a global TOC with brief descriptions of each item)</p><p><em><em><strong>9:21</strong></em></em></p><p>then we can reuse what we have currently, and add what is missing</p><p><em><em><strong>Titus Fortner 9:22 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>So code snippets would look like this: <a href=https://gist.github.com/harsha509/e690dd2c72f1f5c5785be4c8a47c87fd>https://gist.github.com/harsha509/e690dd2c72f1f5c5785be4c8a47c87fd</a></p><p><em><em><strong>Simon Stewart 9:22 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>Lift and shift first, rework second</p><p><em><em><strong>Diego Molina 9:22 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>code snippets is an implementation detail</p><p><em><em><strong>Simon Stewart 9:22 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>(That is, let’s open the door to contributions first, then figure out how things should be shaped)</p><p><em><em><strong>Titus Fortner 9:22 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>I get it&rsquo;s implementation</p><p><em><em><strong>9:23</strong></em></em></p><p>but that&rsquo;s the piece I can help with :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em><em><strong>Diego Molina 9:23 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>right now they look similar to that, so it could be a matter of adjusting things</p><p><em><em><strong>9:24</strong></em></em></p><p>ideally, the future for code snippets is to render code stored in GitHub, so we can execute it in GitHub actions for example</p><p><em><em><strong>Titus Fortner 9:25 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>I guess the question I had about it (what I tried to figure out a few months back and failed) is if there&rsquo;s a way to point to a repo like you & Christian built for Docusaurus :smile:
(another implementation detail)
But&mldr; there&rsquo;s nothing preventing us from writing that code now and figuring it out later</p><p><em><em><strong>David Burns 9:25 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>I like rust for this reason… when you run tests it also tests the doc snippets</p><p><em><em><strong>Titus Fortner 9:25 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>@p0deje implemented that for Ruby</p><p><em><em><strong>9:26</strong></em></em></p><p>it&rsquo;s really neat</p><p>I&rsquo;ll try to find time to propose something here and try to get feedback from people smarter than I am about these things

I believe users are starting to give more feedback, so that’s good</p><p><em><em><strong>9:05 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>I believe we can slowly jump into the first topic:
Pending work for the RC 1?</p><p><em><em><strong>9:06 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>Regarding the Grid, I would say it is feature complete</p><p><em><em><strong>9:07 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>but we have a couple of bugs we are checking with @Puja Jagani</p><p><em><em><strong>9:08 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>I think we can sort them out during the next week
(fingers crossed :slightly_smiling_face:)</p><p><em><em><strong>Diego Molina 9:13 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>talking about the language bindings, I think the most relevant thing for RC1 is to check feature parity</p><p><em><em><strong>Titus Fortner 9:14 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>@AutomatedTester did the shadow Dom work you did end up in geckodriver /Firefox yet?</p><p><em><em><strong>9:15 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>I know some bindings implemented the endpoints already</p><p><em><em><strong>David Burns 9:15 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>No, it’s nearly done</p><p>Maybe I should hand it to the Mozilla folks and maybe they could finish it off</p><p><em><em><strong>Titus Fortner 9:15 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>I kind of wanted to wait until I could make sure tests
passed and stuff because I never trust myself :)</p><p><em><em><strong>David Burns 9:16 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>There is an issue with something between marionette and geckodriver but those are super hard to diagnose</p><p><em><em><strong>Titus Fortner 9:17 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>There were some accessibility endpoints? I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;ve all added.
And I think ruby deprecated methods that other languages implemented with JS</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do a deeper dive into the various tests, but haven&rsquo;t gotten there yet.
Ruby broke CDP in last beta release, we need to figure out</p><p><em><em><strong>9:21 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>We probably need to do a beta 4.1 just for ruby with that fix</p><p><em><em><strong>Diego Molina 9:22 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>Since the VNC stuff has been implemented, I have a bit of time next week to start working in an issue to document feature parity</p><p><em><em><strong>Titus Fortner 9:23 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>I&rsquo;ll dedicate some time this month to helping with it</p><p>Probably the last topic is
Release process</p><p><em><em><strong>9:24 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>Last week Simon recorded the Java release and shared the video so I can document it</p><p>It’d be great if the other folks who also do releases do the same,
so we can document and potentially automate releases</p><p><em><em><strong>Diego Molina 9:30 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>I believe that was everything we had in the agenda</p><p><em><em><strong>Titus Fortner 9:36 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>Documentation. We got an offer from a company to help us with documentation so they can integrate it with their product which is an executable browser IDE thing</p><p>Or something. I&rsquo;m not entirely certain, but sounds potentially interesting.</p><p><em><em><strong>Diego Molina 9:37 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>tell us more, @titusfortner :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em><em><strong>Titus Fortner 9:37 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>I at least want to get a demo and see what they mean.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know more, yet. :)</p><p><em><em><strong>Diego Molina 9:37 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>ah ok, they reached out to you privately :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em><em><strong>Titus Fortner 9:38 PM</strong></em></em></p><p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll loop you in when we set up a demo.

General project statistics
It feels as if folks are trying betas a bit more, I see an increase of issues</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:06 PM</em></p><p>That&rsquo;s a Good Thing.</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:06 PM</em></p><p>Most of the Grid ones can be fixed with docs, so I can take time to do that</p><p>other ones, seem to be either bugs or people just figuring out how to use beta 3, not sure</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:06 PM</em></p><p>I got some informal feedback from someone who said &ldquo;btw it seems a ton more stable than 3.141.59 for us on soak test&rdquo;.</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:06 PM</em></p><p>That is nice to know</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:06 PM</em></p><p>Are there any issues we should be prioritising?</p><p>I&rsquo;ve not read them recently, but if there&rsquo;s a theme, we can try and address the systemic causes</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:09 PM</em></p><p>We also have a few PRs pending to review, some of them related to the Grid,
which @Puja Jagani created, and maybe when things are less intense, you could have a look @simonstewart, please?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:10 PM</em></p><p>Sure. I&rsquo;ll get on that ASAP</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:10 PM</em></p><p>ok, so
Pending work for the Beta 4?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:11 PM</em></p><p>Just the .Net bindings, I think

I think “Distributor follows spec when allocating new sessions” was done, right?</li></ul><p>and I believe @Puja Jagani tackled “Check that the Redis/JDBC backed services actually function”, not sure</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:11 PM</em></p><p>I think so, just checking</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:11 PM</em></p><p>I think so, just checking</p><p><em>9:12 PM</em></p><p>Yeah. We follow the spec better now</p><p>Before rc1, I&rsquo;ll do some more command line testing of it using curl. I bet I can still make it fail</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:13 PM</em></p><p>I was going to start working on “Pipe VNC connectors through the WebSocket plumbing for live video” but
I bumped into the StressTest not passing, which lead to a fix. I want to have this before RC1, hopefully for beta 4</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:13 PM</em></p><p>Hopefully the infrastructure you&rsquo;ll need is already in place.</p><p>I guess you&rsquo;re going to expose a se:vnc capability or similar?</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:14 PM</em></p><p>yes, that is the idea</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:14 PM</em></p><p>Perfect</p><p>Which reminds me, we should make sure that both Sauce and BS know that the Selenium 4 local
ends will all try connecting to se:cdp and their infra could/should/might want to handle that</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 9:18 PM</em></p><p>local ends should only try connecting to that endpoint if using a devtools feature.
Might make sense to just let it error out as unknown endpoint if it isn&rsquo;t supported.</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:18 PM</em></p><p>We are working internally on that, everyone at Sauce is aware :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:18 PM</em></p><p>@titusfortner that&rsquo;s what the java code does</p><p>@diemol that&rsquo;s great news :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:20 PM</em></p><p>Ok, so
Language bindings</p><ul><li>“se:cdpVersion” is missing in C# and JS</li><li>Can all bindings do CDP over Grid?</li></ul><p>I am not sure if @harsha509 and @AutomatedTester had time to use that in the JS bindigns</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:21 PM</em></p><p>If bindings are using se:cdp properly, then they should be able to do CDP over Grid.</p><p><em>Sri Harsha 9:22 PM</em></p><p>No @diemol. As discussed in last we punt it to rc1. If time permits i will look into it for sure</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:22 PM</em></p><p>I think the .Net bindings aren&rsquo;t aware of the se:cdp capability yet</p><p>A quick grep suggests that&rsquo;s true</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:22 PM</em></p><p>thank for the update, @harsha509!</p><p>ok, so maybe we can jump to the next topic:</p><ul><li>What are the features present in Selenium 4?</li><li>Do all bindings implement them?</li></ul><p>I have not been able to get this list done, lack of time and also I do not know where to start to get this information</p><p><em>9:26 PM</em></p><p>from the top of my head, is:</p><ul><li>Relative locators (Java can accept the locator, the other bindings use withTag)</li><li>New tab command</li><li>CDP (but what CDP features?)</li><li>Full page screenshot in Firefox</li><li>Print to PDF</li></ul><p><em>9:26 PM</em></p><p>any others?</p><p><em>Sri Harsha 9:26 PM</em></p><p>JS bindings doesnt have /session/{session id}/element/{element id}/shadow endpoint implemented</p><p><em>9:27 PM</em></p><p>not sure of other language bindings</p><ul><li><p>computedRole</p></li><li><p>computedLabel</p></li></ul><p><em>Titus Fortner 9:28 PM</em></p><p>Do any of the drivers have shadow endpoint implemented?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:28 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;ll wire that into Java next week</p><p><em>Jim Evans 9:28 PM</em></p><p>working away at .NET to get ready for beta.
:tada:
4</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:28 PM</em></p><p>I may wire in a fallback too</p><p><em>Jim Evans 9:29 PM</em></p><p>i want to also include the shadow endpoints, but i may not get to that.</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:29 PM</em></p><p>It can wait for rc1.</p><p><em>9:30 PM</em></p><p>For the record, I&rsquo;m thinking of rc1 as &ldquo;if we want to, we could tag this as 4.0 and be done&rdquo;, so until we ship that, we don&rsquo;t need all the commands in place.
:+1:
1</p><p><em>9:30 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m seriously hoping beta4 is the last beta</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 9:31 PM</em></p><p>So, it&rsquo;s not explicitly on the agenda, but relates to the languages implementing everything&mldr;.</p><p>documentation.</p><p>Would be nice to have something that explains everything that is new with examples in each of the languages</p><p><em>9:31 PM</em></p><p>(as in I am willing to help not just complain about this one)</p><p><em>9:33 PM</em></p><p>but&mldr;</p><ul><li><p>Do we still want to update to a different theme first?</p></li><li><p>Would it be possible to get help from a &ldquo;Technical Content Strategist&rdquo; or the like to help us organize things?</p></li></ul><p><em>Diego Molina 9:33 PM</em></p><p>that is my idea by listing the features and seeing where they are implemented and where they need to be implemented
:+1:
2</p><p><em>Sri Harsha 9:33 PM</em></p><p>I have tried my best to provide examples for all language bindings and a note on top of it like
<a href=https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/browser_manipulation/#create-new-window-or-new-tab-and-switch>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/browser_manipulation/#create-new-window-or-new-tab-and-switch</a></p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:34 PM</em></p><p>@titusfortner a human&rsquo;s guide to the new features is a good idea.</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 9:34 PM</em></p><p>After spending a little time with the Sauce tech content team it has really showed me how
much of a difference it makes to have someone who does this for a living organize things</p><p>I can look at something and say &ldquo;this structure doesn&rsquo;t make sense,&rdquo; but my solution will be something that also doesn&rsquo;t make sense. :smile:</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:36 PM</em></p><p>I want to move to Docsy, a hugo theme that helps us to have website and docs in one single place</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 9:36 PM</em></p><p>and if we can reference code snippets from selenium repo tests rather than
having to create/maintain them independently in our docs that would be huge</p><p>Is docsy the one I was looking at last time (whenever that was)?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:36 PM</em></p><p>@diemol can the move to docsy be done at the same time as the docs themselves are updated?</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:36 PM</em></p><p>and I have found Hugo shortcodes that can render real tests hosted in GitHub repositories, so we can run those tests in GitHub actions and provide working examples

I would provide a full Java/C#/Python Class/Snipped with inline comments that would explain constructs</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 9:41 PM</em></p><p>I loaded the new template, spent like 8 hours tyring to figure
out how to get tabs to work, and then gave up. :smile:</p><p><em>Luis Correia 9:42 PM</em></p><p>bonus points would go to code interacting with an example website</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:42 PM</em></p><p>This is normally the type of thing that gets done when someone spends a

Release process</p><ul><li>After beta 4, we should document how each binding and the Grid are released</li></ul><p><em>Titus Fortner 9:52 PM</em></p><p>For Ruby you need an account on rubygems.

resigned as staff because of what they felt was a hostile takeover</a>.</p><p>Freenode has always been seen as the home of Free and Open Software, so
it was natural that you could find us on the #selenium channel there. To maintain this openness, and inclusivity,
we are moving our IRC Channel over to <a href=https://libera.chat>Libera.chat</a>. It is has been created
by the team that previously maintained Freenode.</p><p>We are in the process of moving our Slack-to-IRC bridge over and hopefully the matrix bridge will be created
soon so that we can have a free and inclusive project on the new IRC Servers. There may be a few
hiccups so if you could bear with us.</p><p>If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me on <a href=https://twitter.com/automatedtester>twitter</a>

:rocket: Feature Proposal
Selenium 4 brings a set of all-new features and <a href=https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/</a> needs to be updated to contain the related docs for them.
Motivation</p><p>It&rsquo;d be nice to have the following new features covered in the docs:
• Relative locators
• CDP integration
• New Grid 4.0

<time datetime=2021-04-26 class=text-body-secondary>Monday, April 26, 2021</time></div><p>Diagnosing problems when the Selenium server isn&rsquo;t working has never been easy. With Selenium 4, we have integrated <a href=https://opentelemetry.io/>OpenTelemetry</a> to help you troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and provide visibility into the system. By making the Selenium server observable, we are putting more power into your hands.</p><h3 id=need-for-observability>Need for Observability</h3><p>Selenium server enables distributed testing. Instead of running the browsers for tests locally, the tests use a remote browser driver that points to a server. The server makes “<strong>smart</strong>” decisions to run tests on different remote servers. Every such remote server is capable of hosting different types of browsers and browser versions.</p><p>Selenium 3 uses Hub as the coordinator. It receives new session requests and directs them to the appropriate Node. The Node is the remote end where the browser itself runs.</p><p>Selenium 4 extends this to provide users with a way to set up a full-blown distributed system. Essentially, <a href=https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/grid/grid_4/components_of_a_grid/>Selenium 4</a> splits the Hub into different components with additional enhancements. However, the Node’s role remains the same. To ensure the backward compatibility and simplicity of setting up Grid, standalone and hub-node mode are also available in the new Selenium server.</p><p>Now picture running a full-blown distributed Selenium Grid with hundreds of Nodes with different browsers and browser versions. Testing at scale in such an infrastructure will involve large volumes of requests. How can one keep track of these requests? Enter Selenium Observability!</p><h3 id=how-does-selenium-provide-observability>How Does Selenium Provide Observability?</h3><p>Selenium uses OpenTelemetry to instrument tracing and event logs. Tracing keeps track of a request’s lifecycle. As a request moves through the distributed system, the trace of the request will contain all the information of its crucial operations performed along the way. Such operations are known as spans. A span can record timed logs called events, which ideally encapsulate the current state of the system. These are event logs.</p><p>By default, the Selenium server enables tracing. Selenium server can run in different modes:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/grid/grid_4/setting_up_your_own_grid/#standalone-mode>Standalone</a></li><li><a href=https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/grid/grid_4/setting_up_your_own_grid/#hub-and-node-mode>Hub and Node</a></li><li><a href=https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/grid/grid_4/setting_up_your_own_grid/#distributed-mode>Fully Distributed</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium#readme>Docker</a></li></ul><p>Tracing and event logs are available for all the modes. The simplest way to see traces is in the form of console logs. By default, the Selenium server prints logs at the INFO level and above. To pass a logging level of choice while running a Selenium Grid use the <a href=https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/grid/grid_4/advanced_features/observability/#visualizing-traces>log-level</a> flag. Setting the log-level to FINE will display traces and event logs as console logs.</p><p>For a large scale system, consuming traces as logs might not be efficient.
Visualizing and querying traces will quickly help troubleshoot a request failure easily. <a href=https://www.jaegertracing.io/>Jaeger</a> seamlessly integrates with OpenTelemetry to provide a rich experience of querying, visualizing and collecting request traces.</p><p>Run <code>java -jar selenium-server-&lt;selenium-version>.jar info tracing</code>.</p><p>It provides detailed and updated instructions to set up Jaeger with the Selenium server.
Visualizing the traces makes it easy to interpret a trace and understand request flow. Now Grid users can effortlessly trace a request, drill down into an error or query them to observe what is happening.</p><figure><img src=/images/blog/2021/trace.png alt="Trace example"></figure><p>Refer to <a href=https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/grid/grid_4/advanced_features/observability/>Selenium Observability</a> for details.</p><h3 id=full-stack-tracing>Full-Stack Tracing</h3><p>The Java client binding supports tracing. Full-stack tracing allows tracing a request from the client to the server and back. Though the client is a single component, the client trace will contain spans that help build the request. It is easier to locate a client-side problem and fix the test if needed.</p><p>We already saw how the server supports tracing and how to leverage it. For the client-side, add the Opentelemetry dependency to your project setup and add the necessary system properties to export the traces to Jaeger. Refer to <a href=https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/remote_webdriver/remote_webdriver_client/#tracing-client-requests>RemoteWebdriver client</a> for detailed instructions.</p><h3 id=leveraging-traces-and-event-logs>Leveraging Traces and Event Logs</h3><p>The key to fixing a problem lies in knowing the error. For a known error situation, the event logs have you covered. It provides detailed error information and stack traces. Query the collected traces for a time range by the error code to identify the frequency of the error. It will help determine if the error is transient or not and accordingly take action.</p><figure><img src=/images/blog/2021/error-event-log.png alt="Error event log example"></figure><p>Observe the request latency to identify potential bottlenecks. Each trace will also contain time taken by each span. The issue could be in the underlying infrastructure setup, the network latency, or the code itself. Irrespective of the cause, it is easier to identify the problem area.</p><p>Observability is slowly becoming a must-have property of a system. Selenium is now observable! Go ahead try it out. Let us know if you find anything that requires improvement on our end.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-babeb0792da4448a8f7068236a4f0871>Public Project Meeting - April 22, 2021</h1><div class=lead>Continuing the series of bi-weekly public project meetings&mldr;</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Sri Harsha (<a href=https://twitter.com/sri_harsha509>@sri_harsha509</a>)</b> |

the bindings they should already have updated. The only stuff really being worked on at this point is grid functionality and adding in the various new features from w3c spec, etc
There is no technological advantage to sticking with 3.x at this point</p><p><em>Luke Hill 9:10 PM</em></p><p>That went against all advice and articles published that explicitly stated

Because they have been able to do it.

that&rsquo;s as of last week</p><p><em>David Burns 10:02 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;ve messaged her in the Mozilla Alumni slack</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 10:03 PM</em></p><p>ok, thanks</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:03 PM</em></p><p>Sounds good, so we covered one topic already :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p>So…
General project statistics</p><ul><li>Previous meeting: 202 open issues, 32 open PRs</li><li>Current: 178, 23 PRs</li></ul><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:04 PM</em></p><p>That&rsquo;s amazing work, folks</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:04 PM</em></p><p>We are doing pretty well there, I went through many issues and asked if
they are still valid. Depending on their reply we can close around 20 more in 2-3 weeks.</p><p>Most of the open issues are either feature requests, for the JS and C# bindings
Perhaps we need to search for folks to give us a hand there</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:06 PM</em></p><p>We could absolutely do with more committers.</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:07 PM</em></p><p>I will look for folks who have frameworks built on
top of Selenium and see if they have time to give us a hand</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:08 PM</em></p><p>That&rsquo;s a great idea</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:08 PM</em></p><p>I’ve seen this one called Watir, maybe they can help us</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:09 PM</em></p><p>They have a slack channel I can ask</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:09 PM</em></p><p>The original idea is from Titus actually :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:09 PM</em></p><p>I mean, I cajoled Thomas from Capybara into helping :-D</p><p>we were down to one ruby labeled issue.
This one we need some kind of decision on: <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/8179>https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/8179</a></p><p>maybe it&rsquo;s a wontfix and can be closed, or we can figure out the right thing and knock out the changes</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:11 PM</em></p><p>Send Keys in actions is really meant for individual key presses.
But I guess we could decompose a more complicated set of inputs to individual key presses and releases</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:14 PM</em></p><p>Would you like to dig deeper into the issue right now, @titusfortner?</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:14 PM</em></p><p>I was generally looking at the needs-discussion ones: <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/labels/A-needs%20decision>https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/labels/A-needs%20decision</a></p><p>if we need a discussion to figure out what is the right thing, this seems like a good forum for that
if we need more info we can push it back til next meeting, etc</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:15 PM</em></p><p>Makes sense, I can definitely go over those issues and put them in the agenda for the next one, good idea</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:15 PM</em></p><p>but no, I don&rsquo;t need anything specific from that one</p><p>right now
just wanted to raise it since we haven&rsquo;t discussed it before :)</p><p>if and when we get guidance I/others can implement it, but need to know what to implement :-D
or I&rsquo;ll make the Watir dev do it</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:18 PM</em></p><p>ok, next topic</p><ul><li>Pending work that needs to be done for the third Beta?</li></ul><p>Things left in Java, Python, JS, Ruby, C#?</p><ul><li>“se:cdpVersion”?</li><li>Can all bindings do CDP over Grid?</li></ul><p>Anything else on the client side?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:19 PM</em></p><p>I have local diffs with se:cdpVersion wired up properly in Firefox and Chromium-based browsers
It&rsquo;s a little funky, and I&rsquo;d like a test around it before doing much more</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:20 PM</em></p><p>We have cdpVersion hard coded for Firefox and are getting browser version to automatically serve the right version to Chrome/Edge
the endpoint would make a couple things easier :)</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:21 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m making the browsers return the cdp version and endpoint in the capabilities</p><p>se:cdpVersion and se:cdp respectively</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:21 PM</em></p><p>oh yes, capabilities not endpoint, I knew what I meant to say in my brain ;-)</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:22 PM</em></p><p>Ha! :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:23 PM</em></p><p>Ok now, Server side:</p><ul><li>Enable retries of commands where necessary using failsafe</li><li>Pipe VNC connectors through the websocket plumbing for live video</li><li>Return CDP url by using the Grid url</li><li>CDP url for Firefox</li><li>Platform matching but when platform is Windows</li><li>Investigate: Grid gets stuck when screenshot is taken in a terminated session</li></ul><p>this is what I have in my list, not sure if there is anything more</p><ul><li>Platform matching bug when platform is Windows</li></ul><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:25 PM</em></p><p>We should already be sending the CDP url for the Grid in Capabilities</p><p>And I&rsquo;ve got the CDP url for Firefox in my local patches</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:25 PM</em></p><p>ah, that is true</p><p>scratching that</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:26 PM</em></p><p>Hurrah! One step closer :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:27 PM</em></p><p>by looking at the download numbers and issues created after beta 2, which is not a lot…
what is our overall feeling about beta 3?</p><p>let’s say, when most of features and bugfixes are done we release it or do we want to wait a bit more for feedback?</p><p><em>David Burns 10:28 PM</em></p><p>I think do the bug fixes and release</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:28 PM</em></p><p>+1 to that</p><p><em>David Burns 10:28 PM</em></p><p>the &ldquo;closer&rdquo; we are to a full release the more our pool will increase</p><p>a &ldquo;better&rdquo; question&mldr; what do we need to get to a RC?</p><p><em>Jim Evans 10:29 PM</em></p><p>.NET doesn’t do CDP over grid right now. a refactor is required to make that possible.
i have it in progress, but it’s not ready to get committe.</p><p><em>David Burns 10:29 PM</em></p><p>so we need ^ to get to RC
what else?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:29 PM</em></p><p>Oh. Yeah. RC backwards compat</p><p><em>David Burns 10:30 PM</em></p><p>I mean harder to get to points but wont stop beta releases</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:30 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;d also like to properly clean up the java client code to strip out JWP support</p><p><em>David Burns 10:30 PM</em></p><p>and RC I mean release candidate</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:30 PM</em></p><p>But I think that&rsquo;s going to be a hard thing to do</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:30 PM</em></p><p>Simon using every chance to ship RC into Selenium 4 :smile:
New</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:30 PM</em></p><p>We can do an RC once we think we&rsquo;ve got all the features done</p><p>I suspect beta 3 may be our last beta, if @jimevans gets the time and support he needs for CDP over Grid</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:32 PM</em></p><p>I am getting a new Windows machine, in part to see how I can help with C#, so expect questions @jimevans :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:32 PM</em></p><p>Amazing! :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Jim Evans 10:33 PM</em></p><p>@diemol happy to collaborate.</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:33 PM</em></p><p>I believe we covered all topics, unless someone has anything else?</p><p><em>Michael Mintz 10:34 PM</em></p><p>Full official release of Selenium 4 by year&rsquo;s end?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:34 PM</em></p><p>Even sooner</p><p>When shall we aim to ship beta3?</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:35 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m waiting for Simon to decide he has to rewrite the Java HTTP Client before we ship Se 4 ;-)</p><p><em>David Burns 10:35 PM</em></p><p>not next week as I am away but the week after maybe?</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:37 PM</em></p><p>2-3 weeks from now would be realistic, I think</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:37 PM</em></p><p>Here&rsquo;s the plan, then. We&rsquo;ll ship beta3 when two of these conditions are met:</p><ul><li>The .net bindings support CDP over Grid</li><li>We send se:cdpVersion in Capabilities and that&rsquo;s also handled by Grid</li><li>Two weeks have passed</li></ul><p>Sound good?</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:38 PM</em></p><p>Sounds good to me</p><p>alright, that sounds like a wrap for today’s meeting…

@AutomatedTester @harsha509 @titusfortner @mmerrell @jimevans @simonstewart @barancev @luke</p><p><em>10:01</em></p><p>Agenda for today:</p><ul><li>General project statistics</li><li>Anything new to report from the last PLC/SFC call?</li><li>CoC, next steps?</li><li>Pending work that needs to be done for the second Beta?</li></ul><p>if you have any more topics, please feel free to add them</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:02 PM</em></p><p>:wave:</p><p><em>Sri Harsha 10:02 PM</em></p><p>:wave:</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:03 PM</em></p><p>ok, let’s start slowly while people join…
first topic is:</p><ul><li>General project statistics</li></ul><p>Previous meeting: 234 open issues, 32 open PRs
Current: 202, 32 PRs</p><p><em>10:04</em></p><p>Again, really great work lowering the number of open issues!</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:05 PM</em></p><p>What I see in the open issues, every now and then, is a few feature requests.</p><p>I think it’d be helpful to give some feedback on them at some point</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:05 PM</em></p><p>I need to remember not to add PRs until after the meeting :)</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:06 PM</em></p><p>for now, I am closing a few feature requests because they are not aligned at all with
Selenium or because no one has commented in over 1.5 years</p><p><em>10:07</em></p><p>ok, let’s move to the next topic
Anything new to report from the last PLC/SFC call?</p><p><em>10:08</em></p><p>@mmerrell @barancev @simonstewart @manoj9788 @jimevans</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:08 PM</em></p><p>Nothing major. @mmerrell was going to chat with the SFC about the Coc</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:08 PM</em></p><p>perfect, that was the next topic, CoC :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p>do we know what we can do to speed the process a bit? We had an incident in the past few
days where a CoC would be helpful <a href=https://groups.google.com/g/selenium-users/c/bpeUO9vAa2A>https://groups.google.com/g/selenium-users/c/bpeUO9vAa2A</a></p><p><em>10:10</em></p><p>Could we add the <a href=https://www.contributor-covenant.org/>https://www.contributor-covenant.org/</a> as a start and then iterate on it when the SFC has time?</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 10:10 PM</em></p><p>that chat happened, and Karen is supposed to reach out to the contractor - I haven&rsquo;t pinged her in a week, but I can do that</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:11 PM</em></p><p>thank you, @mmerrell!</p><p><em>David Burns 10:11 PM</em></p><p>I think we can just copy what Sage did from their repos</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:11 PM</em></p><p>that is also a good idea to have a place to start</p><p><em>David Burns 10:11 PM</em></p><p>yea</p><p><em>10:11</em></p><p>and I think we can have the odd hour from Sage to process it since they work for the SFC now</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:12 PM</em></p><p>I forgot about that, I’d say we can do that</p><p><em>10:13</em></p><p>what do the other folks think?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:13 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m okay with that</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 10:14 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m fine with it&mldr; I simply can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been a year</p><p><em>David Burns 10:16 PM</em></p><p>tbf&mldr; I could have pushed harder but since I am with ${employer} that can be hard to find time</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 10:16 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m in the same boat, but it&rsquo;s unreasonable that we have to push this hard
as far as I know, we&rsquo;re a top revenue driver for the SFC, and asking a
lawyer to do an hour of lawyering does not seem unreasonable</p><p>but we aren&rsquo;t in a position to make a big change here, so I&rsquo;ll keep pressing where I can</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:18 PM</em></p><p>absolutely, at least it feels that we can have a CoC soon by following this path</p><p>do you still have the docs Sage gave us, @AutomatedTester?</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 10:19 PM</em></p><p>if we get that, do we still need to go through the SFC and everything?</p><p><em>David Burns 10:19 PM</em></p><p>I am sure I do</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:19 PM</em></p><p>I think we still need an expert on the field to help us refine
the edges so we are sure we have something good in place</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 10:19 PM</em></p><p>ok, good</p><p><em>10:20</em></p><p>I just pinged KS</p><p><em>David Burns 10:20 PM</em></p><p>at worst I can take Sage&rsquo;s repos and just cobble something together</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:20 PM</em></p><p>perfect, that’d be great</p><p>ok, perhaps we can move to the next topic?</p><ul><li>Pending work that needs to be done for the second Beta?</li></ul><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:24 PM</em></p><p>we&rsquo;re as good on grid as we&rsquo;re going to get without changing the underlying http client, right?</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:24 PM</em></p><p>ok, so this is what I have about that:
Server changes:</p><ul><li>Pipe VNC connectors through the websocket plumbing for live video (nice to have for Beta 2, not a must)</li><li>Return CDP url by using the Grid url (nice to have for Beta 2, not a must)</li><li>Allow timeout, cleanupCycle to be configured in Grid (this is about allowing users configure some timeouts, @Puja Jagani did a part of it already, the rest seems simple, but not a must for Beta 2)</li></ul><p>Things left in Java, Python, JS, Ruby, C#?</p><ul><li>Using se:cdpVersion</li></ul><p>yes, about the http client, I’d say so, but we will know more after people use beta 2</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:25 PM</em></p><p>is there a reason we can&rsquo;t release 2 right away and do the rest for 3?</p><p>there are a few things in the Ruby code I want to be able to start using</p><p>I&rsquo;m assuming there have been enough improvements elsewhere to justify a new release?</p><p>Would be nice to have more smaller releases so long as code/tests are in a good shape</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:27 PM</em></p><p>I also have the feeling that the major issue was the Grid memory usage, which we adjusted by having a single http client instance
everything else seems to be small adjustments, some could happen for beta 2 and the rest for beta 3</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:27 PM</em></p><p>I think so</p><p>I&rsquo;m fine with no getting the se:cdpVersion stuff in before we push the next beta</p><p><em>10:28</em></p><p>Also on my list before 4.0 is getting script pinning using CDP up and running</p><p>That feels somewhat gnarly</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:30 PM</em></p><p>sounds good, so maybe let’s sync during the next days to see when we can release beta 2
(as in, when people are around to give their input as well)</p><p><em>David Burns 10:30 PM</em></p><p>It sounds like there is nothing left to do&mldr;</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:30 PM</em></p><p>we need to fix the javadocs</p><p><em>David Burns 10:31 PM</em></p><p>yes!</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:31 PM</em></p><p>(maybe that is the most important issue for now :slightly_smiling_face:)</p><p><em>David Burns 10:32 PM</em></p><p>definitely the most important issue</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:33 PM</em></p><p>ok, I think that was the meeting for today, do we have anything else we’d like to discuss?</p><p><em>David Burns 10:33 PM</em></p><p>nope</p><p><em>Sri Harsha 10:33 PM</em></p><p>we need to update JS doc too</p><p><a href=https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html>https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html</a></p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:34 PM</em></p><p>true, while checking old issues, there are 3-4 we could close by updating the docs</p><p>ok, so let’s wrap today’s meeting with that, thank you everyone!</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-0b9912e936270d0e7ccf501469b378dd>Public Project Meeting - February 25, 2021</h1><div class=lead>Continuing the series of bi-weekly public project meetings&mldr;</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Sri Harsha (<a href=https://twitter.com/sri_harsha509>@sri_harsha509</a>)</b> |

Feel free to add/propose any other topics</p><p><em>Luke Hill 9:59 PM</em></p><p>Alongside that, do we have a rough idea of what would enable us to release a 4.0.0 proper (i.e. what milestones we need to hit)</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:01 PM</em></p><p>Let’s wait a few minutes to see if we have enough people to start the meeting</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:04 PM</em></p><p>I have a couple minor things I want to do before beta2, but the sooner the better for me :)</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:04 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m in a planning meeting, but I&rsquo;ll follow along slowly</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:05 PM</em></p><p>(Element#dom_attribute is the main one I want to finish).

it is used for Gatling</p><p><em>10:09</em></p><p>(a loat test tool)</p><p><em>10:10</em></p><p>load*</p><p><em>David Burns 10:12 PM</em></p><p>@simonstewart what&rsquo;s left, assuming its everything, to &ldquo;Ensure CDP on Grid to a Docker instance works&rdquo;</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:12 PM</em></p><p>(In a meeting)</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:13 PM</em></p><p>each of the bindings need to be able to implement that part (getting debugger address from caps, etc)</p><p><em>David Burns 10:13 PM</em></p><p>@titusfortner it&rsquo;s done?</p><p><em>10:14</em></p><p>it gets it from se:options</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:14 PM</em></p><p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s done yet with the first part</p><p>he&rsquo;s changing that</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:14 PM</em></p><p>se:cdp now

Which is half the battle.</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:17 PM</em></p><p>With @p0deje been gone for a while and @twalpole being super busy it&rsquo;s just a matter of bandwidth. :)</p><p>well, partly, I only know &ldquo;ish&rdquo;</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:17 PM</em></p><p>it’s the chance for @luke to do some commits :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Luke Hill 10:18 PM</em></p><p>I can try help where possible. But I&rsquo;m not quite on their standard.</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:18 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;d also like to figure out how to do a different gem publishing for CDP versions</p><p><em>10:19</em></p><p>it&rsquo;s more important that we be able to update the CDP versions to match the browser versions than Selenium methods to CDP methods, so I&rsquo;d like to be able to release the artifacts independently, and let users toggle it somehow.</p><p><em>Luke Hill 10:19 PM</em></p><p>By Easter I will hopefully be in somewhere more stable again either renting or buying my first place. So yeh should be able to do more in evenings. This is going to be my fifth property move in just over 2 years</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:22 PM</em></p><p>How much work is there still in the leak investigation? (I ask because I literally have no idea what all is involved)</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:23 PM</em></p><p>Not sure, I’ve invested this week and at least I’ve pinned it down to the Distributor</p><p><em>10:24</em></p><p>It eats memory over time when new tests are executed, and never returns it</p><p>I am now checking if the problem is really related to the AsyncHttpClient</p><p><em>10:25</em></p><p>well, more related to the way we use it</p><p><em>David Burns 10:25 PM</em></p><p>@diemol @Puja Jagani knows this is a priority so feel free to rope her in :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:26 PM</em></p><p>they recommend to have a single instance, and in the Distributor we have one instance per registered node, and one instance to do the health checks, and another one that I have not pinned down to see what it is</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:30 PM</em></p><p>Because each instance needs its own config</p><p><em>10:31</em></p><p>If we could change config per request, we&rsquo;d be fine</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:31 PM</em></p><p>they have a different base url, right?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:31 PM</em></p><p>Right</p><p><em>10:32</em></p><p>And possibly time outs</p><p>Anything on the config object</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:33 PM</em></p><p>I did not see different timeouts, but we will need them when we allow users to configure the timeout in Grid</p><p><em>Puja Jagani</em></p><p>I think the RequestBuilder allows to set timeouts per request.</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:34 PM</em></p><p>so, hm, interesting…
now sure what to do now :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:35 PM</em></p><p>Once again, I shall mutter about writing our own http client based on netty, starting from the one we have for domain sockets</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-2c206a3d634855a8cb05c4a7855388b1>Selenium 4 Beta 1 Released</h1><div class=lead>We&rsquo;re very happy to announce the release of the first beta of Selenium 4.</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Simon Stewart (<a href=https://twitter.com/shs96c>@shs96c</a>)</b> |
<time datetime=2021-02-15 class=text-body-secondary>Monday, February 15, 2021</time></div><p>We&rsquo;re very happy to announce the release of the first beta of Selenium
4. We&rsquo;re shipping this for Java, .Net, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript,
so if you&rsquo;re using any of those languages, go and grab it from your
package manager of choice!</p><p>This has been the culmination of a lot of work by so many people, not
only the <a href=/project/structure/#tlc>project TLC</a>, but also of literally hundreds of people:
205 since we released Selenium 3.141.59, at the last count. A big
thank you to everybody who&rsquo;s helped make this possible!</p><p>So, what&rsquo;s changed since Selenium 3? The answer is both &ldquo;<strong>not much</strong>&rdquo;
and also &ldquo;<strong>almost everything</strong>&rdquo;.</p><p>By &ldquo;<strong>not much</strong>&rdquo;, I mean that if your tests are working with Selenium
3 right now, you should be able to just upgrade your dependency to
Selenium 4. You will find that things that were marked &ldquo;deprecated&rdquo;
are now gone, but the advantage of the long time between the last
Selenium 3 release and this is that you&rsquo;ve had plenty of time to try
and find alternatives.</p><p>If this doesn&rsquo;t work, please let us know! We&rsquo;ve worked hard to ensure
compatibility between the releases, but it&rsquo;s possible we may have
missed some things.</p><p>One thing you may want to do to get ready for the update (which you
can do before updating the dependency itself!) is to update the
drivers you need. In particular, please update <a href=https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases>geckodriver</a> to
0.29.0 or later.</p><p>By &ldquo;<strong>almost everything</strong>&rdquo;, I mean that under the covers there have
been substantial changes. We&rsquo;ve rewritten the Selenium server to allow
it to work not only in the familiar &ldquo;standalone&rdquo; and &ldquo;hub and node&rdquo;
modes, but also in a new &ldquo;distributed&rdquo; mode, which makes it
signifcantly easier to deploy to something such as Kubernetes in a way
that scales well.</p><p>The new server is also wired up with support for <a href=https://opentelemetry.io>OpenTelemetry</a> and
exposes a <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/selenium-4.0.0-beta-1/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/grid/graphql/selenium-grid-schema.graphqls>GraphQL endpoint</a>, so that figuring what&rsquo;s going
on in the Grid, and tracking down what&rsquo;s gone wrong if something
happens, is easier than ever.</p><p>Not all the changes are server-side. We recently wrote about the <a href=/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-new-tricks/>new
features in Selenium 4</a> that you can use in your tests, but some
of the main highlights are:</p><ul><li>Relative locators, for finding elements using terms that make
sense to us humans.</li><li>The ability to intercept network traffic</li><li>Authentication with basic or digest authentication.</li></ul><p>We&rsquo;ll be telling you more about these features in later blog posts,
and as we improve our documentation.</p><p>If this sounds interesting, please download the beta from your
favourite package manager (maven, nuget, npm, pip, or the gem), or
directly from the <a href=/downloads/>Selenium site</a>.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-2dc3ff2c2e2d8f5be490c0dda06b79c8>Public Project Meeting - February 11, 2021</h1><div class=lead>Continuing the series of bi-weekly public project meetings&mldr;</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Diego Molina (<a href=https://twitter.com/diegofmolina>@diegofmolina</a>)</b> |

<time datetime=2021-02-05 class=text-body-secondary>Friday, February 05, 2021</time></div><blockquote><p>In the fourth and final post in his series, Simon Stewart continues talking about what&rsquo;s
coming in Selenium 4 and reviews what&rsquo;s new in the Selenium Grid.</p></blockquote><p>We’ve covered a lot of ground in the past few blog posts, including how to contribute to the project, and some
details of what you can expect as a Selenium user. But there’s more to Selenium than just the APIs you use to write
your tests, and one of the big features we’ve not covered yet is the refreshed Selenium Grid: a mechanism that
allows you to distribute your tests across a fleet of machines.</p><p>Before going further, it’s always nice to acknowledge where we’ve come from, not only because it’s interesting, but
also because it helps explain the “why” of the refreshed design.</p><p>Way back in the mists of time (2008), Jennifer Bevin and Jason Huggins worked on a system called the Selenium Farm
at Google. This was a fleet of machines sitting in a cupboard somewhere that allowed you to run the original
Selenium protocol. This was, of course, at Google scale, so there was more than one cupboard :)</p><p>This allowed people at Google to distribute their tests and scale out beyond their individual machines.
This was such a great idea that when Jennifer talked about the Farm at a Selenium meetup, Philippe
Haringou (then at ThoughtWorks) decided to write an Open Source implementation of the same thing,
which he called “Selenium Grid”.</p><p>Selenium Grid was a lovely piece of technology, but it had one drawback: it only spoke the original
Selenium RC protocol. That was fine, but WebDriver spoke a different wire protocol, which was called the
JSON Wire Protocol, and folks wanted to be able to use both Selenium RC and WebDriver at the same time.</p><p>This is where Francois Reynaud enters the picture. He was working at eBay, reporting to Michael Palotas,
and he had written something like the original Selenium Grid, but which also worked with the JSON Wire
Protocol. They very kindly contributed that work to the Selenium project, and it formed the basis of the
Selenium Grid 2. We decided at the time that the Selenium standalone server would effectively be a
“grid of one”: it would have everything you needed in it to set up a Selenium Grid, as well as to work as
a single standalone server. Merging the code and getting it stable took a while, but thanks to the efforts
of Francois, Kristian Rosenvold, and many others, we merged Grid 2 into the main Selenium project and shipped
Selenium 2 in 2011.</p><p>Even if 2011 doesn’t feel that long ago, the modern world has changed quite significantly. In 2011, we didn&rsquo;t
have Docker. We didn&rsquo;t have Kubernetes, we didn&rsquo;t really have AWS. So, the Selenium Grid didn&rsquo;t know that those
things were coming in, and wasn&rsquo;t written to take advantage of them. Fortunately, we did have virtual machines
back then, and the Grid 2 had been designed to be able to support them.</p><p>This was the hook that an excellent project called Zalenium. Developed by Diego Molina, Zalenium added a really
nice UI and support for Docker and Kubernetes—all built on top of the Grid 2. This has allowed the Selenium Grid to
continue to be relevant and useful to this day, which is an amazing achievement.</p><p>But, like I said, it took us time to stabilise Grid 2: about six months of hard work, largely led by Kristian.
That’s because while Grid 2 was sophisticated, the code was hard to read and hard to maintain—and very few people
could do that. Worse, the merging of the Grid 2 and the original Selenium server was pretty crude; effectively
there were two separate servers shipped in the same binary. This led to problems occurring in the Grid but not
when run in standalone mode, and vice versa.</p><p>With Selenium 4 we’ve decided to bite the bullet and address these three concerns. Firstly, we want something that
was easier to work on and maintain. Secondly, we want to merge the servers into a single unit. Thirdly, we want
something that will take advantage of the world of modern infrastructure we have available to us now, not just in
the form of Docker and Kubernetes, but also to be able to use emerging technologies such as distributed tracing.</p><p>To do this, we looked at the functionality the Grid provided, and to model each piece as a component that we can
either run “in memory” (allowing us to have a single standalone server), or in a more distributed way, allowing
the “hub and node” architecture that we’re familiar with from the original Selenium Grid, to a fully distributed
design.</p><p>The first component is the “router”. It serves as the entry point to the Grid. You can expose it to the internet
and it directs requests to the Grid. It’s designed to be stateless, and so you can add more to Grid as you find
you need to.</p><p>When the router sees a new session request, it places it on a “session queue.” The session queue is read by a
component called the “distributor,” which maintains a model of all the places in the Grid where a session could be
run: we call them “slots”. The slots are hosted by components called “nodes,” and each node can have one or more
slots. When the distributor pulls a new session request from the queue, it identifies the most appropriate slot
to use, and forwards the request to the node which owns the slot. Once the node has started the session, the
distributor puts the session ID and the URL of the Node that is running the test into the “session map”—you can
think of the session map as being a simple map of a session ID to URL—and the new session response is sent
back to the waiting test.</p><p>Requests for running sessions (that is, for most webdriver calls!) are handled slightly differently. The router
will use the session map to look up which node to forward the request to, avoiding the need to involve the
distributor entirely. This means that you can just keep adding nodes to the Grid, and there are fewer bottlenecks
in the architecture to slow your requests down.</p><p>Conceptually, there are these five moving pieces within the Grid. But there&rsquo;s actually a sixth one, which is a
message bus. The five Grid components communicate internally through the message bus, but the actual components
that you need to think about when you&rsquo;re thinking about the Grid are the Router, Session Queue, Distributor, and
Nodes.</p><p>When you run Selenium Grid 4 in “standalone” mode, you actually get a “grid of one”. We wire up all these
components in a single process, but they’re all still there.</p><p>You can also run it in the traditional Hub and Node approach that you&rsquo;ve seen with Selenium Grid 2, where you
fire up a Hub and a Node and it registers. If you&rsquo;ve used Selenium Grid recently, that&rsquo;s probably the architecture
that you&rsquo;re familiar with. In this case, most of the components (the router, session queue, and distributor) are
running in the Hub, and the Nodes run the sessions themselves.</p><p>What’s new with Grid 4 is that you can go into a fully distributed mode if you want to. Typically, you would want
to use something like Kubernetes for this, and some of the key components are designed to store data using a
database or Redis for better reliability and scalability.</p><p>Something to note is that when running a distributed Grid, it becomes really difficult to figure out what is
happening, particularly when something goes wrong. To alleviate that problem, we have adopted Open Telemetry to
bring observability into the Grid. What do we mean by observability? It simply means that we want to be able to
see everything that happens.</p><p>Finally, we’d like to expose information about the running Grid in meaningful and useful ways. The original
Grid supported both JMX (a Java management API) and an HTML-based console. While nice, this didn’t make it easy
to query specific areas of the Grid that you might be interested in that weren’t surfaced by the UI (for example,
how many slots are available, or to find out which node a particular session is running on) To provide more
flexibility, we’ve chosen to provide a GraphQL endpoint for the Grid. To ensure that GraphQL endpoint is
sufficiently flexible, we’re building the new Grid console using it. That should allow you to also extract useful
metrics and information from the Grid for your monitoring needs.</p><p>Those are some highlights of the new Selenium Grid. What are you the most excited about?</p><p><em>This was originally posted at <a href=https://saucelabs.com/blog/whats-coming-in-selenium-4-the-new-selenium-grid>https://saucelabs.com/blog/whats-coming-in-selenium-4-the-new-selenium-grid</a></em></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-7269acc2d8f148671e90319fd28548ae>Public Project Meeting - January 28, 2021</h1><div class=lead>Continuing the series of bi-weekly public project meetings&mldr;</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Sri Harsha (<a href=https://twitter.com/sri_harsha509>@sri_harsha509</a>)</b> |

Pending work that needs to be done for the first Beta?
here is the list I have from the last meeting</p><p><em>10:15 PM</em></p><h3 id=client-facing-changes>Client facing changes:</h3><ul><li>Make relative locators return elements sorted by proximity</li><li>Fix Java Module System problems (I think @simonstewart did this already)</li><li>Allow locator strategies to be pluggable Enable fallbacks for commands</li></ul><h3 id=server-changes>Server changes:</h3><ul><li>Enable retries of commands where necessary using failsafe</li><li>Get the Grid UI looking nice, and returning useful data (@diemol is working on this)</li><li>Allow locator strategies to be pluggable</li><li>Pipe VNC connectors through the websocket plumbing for live video</li></ul><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:15 PM</em></p><p>Relative locators now sort by proximity
I think the Java Module stuff is working
I&rsquo;m working on fallbacks for locators</p><p><em>Alexei Barantsev 10:15 PM</em></p><p>I can confirm that java 9 modules are usable now</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:16 PM</em></p><p>Locator strategies are pluggable on the server side
Once I get the locator strategies falling back on the local end, I&rsquo;m fine with shipping the beta</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:17 PM</em></p><p>we had some issue reports related to the Grid, in most of the cases it is a matter of showing the correct information on the UI
and I am working on that</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:18 PM</em></p><p>Also there&rsquo;s a nasty issue with starting a large number of sessions concurrently</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:18 PM</em></p><p>yeah, I was going to point that one out, <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9112>https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9112</a>
I have not had time to research enough, but most of the results when googling point to: either we are creating too many Netty clients or something is wrong with the way the client is created</p><p><em>David Burns 10:20 PM</em></p><p>Feel free to pull in @Puja Jagani on the sessions one, I know she was looking at one about starting up a grid and things not working</p><p><em>10:20 PM</em></p><p>(can&rsquo;t remember the issue #)</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:20 PM</em></p><p>that’d be great, I can sync with @Puja Jagani later
what do you all estimate for a beta release? 3-4 weeks?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:21 PM</em></p><p>Maybe less</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:23 PM</em></p><p>ok, I think we do not have more things pending for beta 1?
the only topic left is the CoC
New</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:24 PM</em></p><p>Is this a good time/forum to ask about wiki/docs?</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:24 PM</em></p><p>always</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:25 PM</em></p><p>Diego pointed me at a couple issues @AutomatedTester created for docs & wiki cleanup things
did we have an idea for what we want in the language specific wiki page vs in the docs; and user vs developer focused?
The Ruby wiki stuff is way out of date, not even just Selenium 4 things :)
just want to know where we should be cleaning it up to</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:28 PM</em></p><p>are those two different things?
language specific things
and
dev docs? (people who want to contribute to Selenium, what technical steps to follow?)</p><p><em>David Burns 10:28 PM</em></p><p>CoC is still waiting on SFC.
New</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:29 PM</em></p><p>What we did with Watir was to make the wiki about things devs need to know about the project building/deploying, etc
and everything user related went into the documentation
oh, heh, looks like we ended up deleting the wiki and sending everything to the website</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:32 PM</em></p><p>Why do we need a language bindings specific things on the user docs?
Do they differ too much on how they work?</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:33 PM</em></p><p>So our current documentation has tabs to show the examples in each of the languages
the wiki is currently just a big page of examples for using Ruby Selenium (<a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Ruby-Bindings>https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Ruby-Bindings</a>)</p><p><em>10:37</em></p><p>I guess I haven&rsquo;t spent much time with the docs anyway, so maybe I should play around and see what makes sense.
Didn&rsquo;t know if anyone else had opinions on any of it. :)
Guess not</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:38 PM</em></p><p>ah ok, that Wiki seems to be duplicating the user docs
but some parts of the Wiki could evolve to be part of the user docs</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:39 PM</em></p><p>yeah, it&rsquo;s 2 approaches to organization as well; here&rsquo;s everything in ruby, vs here&rsquo;s everything, click the tab for each to see the ruby.</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:39 PM</em></p><p>I think the 2nd could work well
someone needs to take the time and take the contents of that Wiki and put them in the docs</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:39 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;ll take a look at what might make sense since now that I no longer have any looming work pressing things for the first time in forever</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:40 PM</em></p><p>cool

We&rsquo;re still hopeful that with the vaccine, this will be possible. we&rsquo;ll look to make a final decision, based on numbers, in ~April
:parrot:</p><p><em>10:11 PM</em></p><p>We need to consider whether or not to run a virtual conference in the case that it doesn&rsquo;t work out to have an irl conference</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:11 PM</em></p><p>Can that decision also be delayed until April?</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 10:11 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m a little uncomfortable waiting that long&ndash;not for the hotel and
the risk of losing the deposit $$, but because of marketing/CFP stuff
let&rsquo;s say &ldquo;early April&rdquo;</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:12 PM</em></p><p>Great news about the CoC!
ok, seems we covered also the “Anything new to report from the last PLC/SFC call?” topic as well, right?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:14 PM</em></p><p>I think so</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:15 PM</em></p><p>ok, so let’s jump to “Pending work that needs to be done for the first Beta?”</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:15 PM</em></p><p>There’s a few things</p><p><em>10:16 PM</em></p><p>I’ve a PR out for the new RemoteWebDriverBuilder, which is one piece.
The other big bit for me is the pluggable locators, tying up the local and remote ends bits we already have.
That’ll be easier with the RemoteWebDriverBuilder in place.</p><p><em>10:17 PM</em></p><p>(As it’s essentially creating new decorators of the CommandExecutor)
I’d also like to ensure that things like the relative locators and script pinning work as advertised, but that’s a relatively slim tranche of work
My next hacking days are Monday and Tuesday next week</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:18 PM</em></p><p>here is a list from the previous status meeting:
Client facing changes:</p><ul><li>Make relative locators return elements sorted by proximity</li><li>Fix Java Module System problems</li><li>Allow locator strategies to be pluggable
Enable fallbacks for commands</li><li>Server changes:</li><li>Enable retries of commands where necessary using failsafe</li><li>Get the Grid UI looking nice, and returning useful data</li><li>Allow locator strategies to be pluggable</li><li>Pipe VNC connectors through the websocket plumbing for live video</li></ul><p><em>10:19 PM</em></p><p>I think this is (partly?) done “Allow locator strategies to be pluggable”
and I remember @simonstewart did this “Make relative locators return elements sorted by proximity”</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:19 PM</em></p><p>I did
The Java Module System thing is a good point, but not a huge amount of work</p><p><em>10:20 PM</em></p><p>Though it’s a little fiddly</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:20 PM</em></p><p>is the &ldquo;pluggable&rdquo; part a Java specific thing, or something new that the server is going to support that opens up new opportunities for dynamic languages?</p><p><em>David Burns 10:20 PM</em></p><p>@Puja Jagani could probably look at the Java Module work</p><p><em>Puja Jagani</em></p><p>Sure! I can take that up</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:20 PM</em></p><p>I can discuss the changes with her</p><p><em>10:21 PM</em></p><p>@titusfortner the remote end bits of the pluggable locators allow us to avoid sending large payloads across the wire for (eg) finding by react
But it requires the local end to know in advance that it can use that mechanism
Tying the pieces together with a fallback allows the local end to try the efficient way first and then fallback to the inefficient way</p><p><em>10:22 PM</em></p><p>It shouldn’t be a particularly challenging thing to do once the pieces are all nicely lined up, but getting the pieces lined up has taken time :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:24 PM</em></p><p>I am slowly getting more time to work on some open issues and getting some items from that list on the server done, like using failsafe for retries</p><p><em>Puja Jagani</em></p><p>I created a PR to get started on that front for transient errors, please have a look when time permits. I think that might serve as the starting point.</p><p><em>Diego Molina</em></p><p>perfect, will do</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:24 PM</em></p><p>I think the BrowserStack folks (particularly @rajendra?) are hacking on the Grid UI and can give an update on that
I’m happy to punt the failsafe stuff for the beta, but it really should be in place for the 4.0 release</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:24 PM</em></p><p>I saw one or two GH issues related to that, if I am faster than @rajendra I can tackle it and get familiar with the UI
I would leave this one out as well
Pipe VNC connectors through the websocket plumbing for live video</p><p><em>10:25 PM</em>
for beta 1
hopefully it could be there for the 4.0 release</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:25 PM</em></p><p>I think that’s just a case of adding the video URL to the se:options in the server
Should be in the same place as we add the bit for cdp</p><p><em>David Burns 10:26 PM</em></p><p>I had a quick look at the grid-ui in a stream&mldr; my CSS sucksbut happy to pair up and fix</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:26 PM</em></p><p>ah, so the scope is way smaller than what I was thinking</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:26 PM</em></p><p>The WebSocket forwarding either works or it doesn’t. If it doesn’t, CDP over the Grid is broken
And I already got the CDP over Grid working :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>David Burns 10:26 PM</em></p><p>@Puja Jagani is looking at adding a few more issues with graphql that we can surface</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:27 PM</em></p><p>so we offer the WebSocket endpoint and the user can use it to stream</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:27 PM</em></p><p>Can we “drain” using GraphQL yet?</p><p><em>David Burns</em></p><p>I dont think so</p><p><em>David Burns</em></p><p>we can get the grid ui to call a normal url</p><p><em>Simon Stewart</em></p><p>The idea would be to use GraphQL for the entire UI….</p><p><em>David Burns</em></p><p>We can add it &ldquo;soon&rdquo; but since it works we don&rsquo;t need to block a beta on it. Let&rsquo;s have a stretch for it</p><p><em>Simon Stewart</em></p><p>But it doesn’t work if you have a distributed grid</p><p><em>Simon Stewart</em></p><p>It’s one of the “tracer bullets” of the graphql stuff, and really does need to be in</p><p><em>Simon Stewart</em></p><p>I want the beta as much as anyone, but there are some corners we should avoid cutting</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:27 PM</em></p><p>@diemol it’s a tiny bit more than that, but, yeah</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:27 PM</em></p><p>I thought we wanted to put that in the Grid UI</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:27 PM</em></p><p>We do before 4.0</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:27 PM</em></p><p>we would need to embed a VNC client in the UI for that</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:27 PM</em></p><p>But for the alpha, I’m happy with the endpoint being exposed and being able to wire up a vnc viewer locally that goes through the grid
@diemol what did zalenium use?</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:28 PM</em></p><p>noVNC, but that was something that you need to install on the host, IIRC</p><p><em>10:29 PM</em></p><p>ah, I think it also has a JS library, it “should” work
there is also an alternative called “Guacamole”</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:29 PM</em></p><p><a href=http://guacamole.apache.org>http://guacamole.apache.org</a> might be useful
Ha!</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:30 PM</em></p><p>right, so I can look at that at some point</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:30 PM</em></p><p>Awesome. Thank you</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:30 PM</em></p><p>coming back to pluggable locators, it is working in Java
but we would need the other bindings to implement it, right?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:31 PM</em></p><p>When it’s working in Java, yes :slightly_smiling_face:
But I think it’s enough to get them in one binding for the beta, and the others can follow</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:31 PM</em></p><p>Also, the reworked logic for relative locators has been implemented only in Java?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:32 PM</em></p><p>The reworked logic was in the atom.
Everyone has it
Yay for the atoms!</p><p><em>10:32</em></p><p>:slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:32 PM</em></p><p>That’s great!
Do we have anything else?
I will (for sure) this time create GitHub issues for the different items</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:34 PM</em></p><p>And add them to the project plan, please!</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:34 PM</em></p><p>absolutely</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:35 PM</em></p><p>Thank you</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:36 PM</em></p><p>Well, I think we do not have other topics, should we cut it short?
New</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:38 PM</em></p><p>I’m down with that. Thanking for running this!
Unless @jimevans has something to add? I see he’s typing</p><p><em>Jim Evans 10:38 PM</em></p><p>re pluggable locators: that’s just having findElement(s) call down the wire using the end point without validating the using and value params, yeah?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:39 PM</em></p><p>That’s what the java code does at the moment</p><p><em>Jim Evans 10:39 PM</em></p><p>cool. .NET can do that too right now, i think (will have to confirm)</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:39 PM</em></p><p>I want to land a few more smarts</p><p><em>David Burns 10:39 PM</em></p><p>I expect the python and ruby code can do it to since monkey patching is easy
and then add smarts too
improve docs ftw</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:43 PM</em></p><p>ok, seems we are done with the status meeting, thank you everyone!</p><p><em>Jim Evans 10:45 PM</em></p><p>re beta readiness: i have a refactor to .NET i want to do to make CDP via RemoteWebDriver easier/more correct, but it can wait until post-beta1</p><p><em>10:45</em></p><p>otherwise, i think .NET is ready for beta.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-8d43181f104adf342838454a12cdd390>Results of the first ever selenium survey</h1><div class=lead>Summary of the Selenium survey that was collected</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>David Burns (<a href=https://twitter.com/AutomatedTester>@AutomatedTester</a>)</b> |
<time datetime=2021-01-12 class=text-body-secondary>Tuesday, January 12, 2021</time></div><p>Below is a summary of the Selenium survey that was collected.</p><h2 id=batteries-included>Batteries included</h2><h3 id=browser-management>Browser Management</h3><p>Unsurprisingly, people find having to manage browsers a task they wish they didn’t have to do and wish that Selenium did this. 59.5% of respondents want Selenium to manage the browsers for them. This, though the question didn’t ask this, is to include the browser drivers.</p><h3 id=frameworks>Frameworks</h3><p>The results show an interesting view into framework usage. 61% of users use a framework. When we look closer at some of the responses there could be a little language bias in there. Some responses in the “both” category are “depends on the language” or “depends on the project”. Frameworks, from a couple responses seem to be around JavaScript mostly.</p><h2 id=how-tests-are-run>How tests are run</h2><p>One of the questions that was the most surprising was that people dislike running their tests in headless. 57% of people don’t want headless. This is surprising since puppeteer and playwright are up and coming tools that default to headless.</p><h3 id=browsers>Browsers</h3><p>People tend to favour evergreen, or the latest version from auto updating browsers, with over 55% of people wanting that. When we look at the data closer then people tend to do evergreen and then a specific version for IE.</p><p>People are also, overwhelmingly I should add, wanting to test on multiple browsers. 78% of people test with multiple browsers. This goes against the Chrome only support that we see on social media. The most used browsers for testing are (Percentage of respondents testing with browser):</p><ul><li><p>Google Chrome (98%)</p></li><li><p>Firefox (67%)</p></li><li><p>Microsoft Edge (33%)</p></li><li><p>Safari (29%)</p></li><li><p>IE (13.5%)</p></li></ul><p>One thing that is clear is that Testing against multiple browsers is hard. 51.6% say it’s hard and a further 27.3% being 3 out of 5. This is likely where some frameworks are becoming popular as it removes some of the need to understand the asynchronicity of browsers. This still has its problems in puppeteer and playwright as they add similar wait libraries to what Selenium has.</p><h3 id=mobile-browsers>Mobile Browsers</h3><p>One of the most surprising things to have come out of survey was the want to use mobile browsers more.</p><p>Of the 410 respondents 367 want to test on mobile. Interestingly, this goes well past just Chrome for Android and Safari for iOS.</p><p>Below is a list of browsers and percentage of users wanting to use it. Questions were designed for Android unless it said iOS. See note at the end of the section.</p><ul><li><p>Firefox for Android: 38%</p></li><li><p>Chrome: 91%*</p></li><li><p>Microsoft Edge: 14%</p></li><li><p>Samsung Internet: 16.6%</p></li><li><p>Safari on iOS: 69%</p></li></ul><p>*Note that the questionaire only mentioned Chrome so it could be a conflation between platforms here. 1 Person used the other field to add Chrome for iOS.</p><h3 id=language-support>Language support</h3><p>Language support is what one would suspect with most users using Java or python.</p><ul><li><p>java: 67%</p></li><li><p>python: 31%</p></li><li><p>ruby: 6.1%</p></li><li><p>.NET: 17.6%</p></li><li><p>JavaScript: 21.4%</p></li><li><p>PHP: 1.5%</p></li></ul><h2 id=improvements>Improvements</h2><p>After reviewing the “What one thing would you improve about Selenium I was able to narrow most of the responses down to similar types.</p><p>Below is a breakdown of the issues that people would like to see improved.</p><figure><img src=/images/blog/2021/breakdown_of_answers.png alt="Breakdown of answers of areas needing improvement.
