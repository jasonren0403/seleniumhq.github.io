Selenium 4 and reviews some of the tricks in the new release.</p></blockquote><p>In my last posts, we talked about
<a href=/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-how-can-i-contribute/>how to contribute to Selenium</a>, and
<a href=/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-why-the-major-version-bump/>why we’re bumping the version number to 4</a>.
That’s enough preamble! Today, we’ll cover some details about the new tricks and capabilities
that Selenium 4 offers.</p><h2 id=finding-elements-and-relative-locators>Finding Elements, and Relative Locators</h2><p>You know, finding elements on a page can be really difficult. I&rsquo;ve seen loads of people using
very complicated XPATH expressions, and trying to figure out complex CSS selectors and things
like that. There have been whole talks about the subject at SeleniumConf. Surely there must
be a better way to do this?</p><p>Think about how we describe where an element is on the page. Think about how you’d do this
over the phone. You’d never talk about the raw DOM, “Ah, find the fifth DIV element nested
inside the SPAN with an ‘id’ of ‘foo’”. You’d just never say that! Instead, you’d say
something like, “just find that thing above that image, and to the right of that link,”
when talking about where things are located on the page.</p><p>A long time ago, a project called <a href=https://sahipro.com>Sahi</a> started to locate elements
like this. Sahi had <a href=https://sahipro.com/docs/sahi-apis/accessor-api-basics.html#Use%20of%20Positional%20Relation%20APIs>Relation APIs</a>, which are a lovely way of finding elements,
and it was very, very fluent and pleasant to use. When I was starting WebDriver years ago,
I was talking with <a href=https://twitter.com/narayanraman>Narayan</a> (creator of Sahi) and I
promised him that I was going to hold off implementing this flagship feature of Sahi. It
was something that was lovely, but it was also something Sahi was rightly proud of. However,
there are now other tools, such as Tyco, that are implementing this style of API, so it
seems like the time is right to do the same in Selenium. In Selenium 4 we call them
“relative locators.” You may sometimes see us refer to them as “friendly locators,” since the
initial implementation called them that, but “relative” better describes how they work. We
have a handful of them: near, above, below, left of, right of. They allow you to talk in human
language about where an element is on a page.</p><p>Looking at the future, we are also planning to enable users to add new types of locators,
not only on the, on the client side, but also to the Selenium Server. For example, although
JS UI frameworks come and go (anyone else remember using jquery?), it’d be nice to be able
to add a custom locator for the current tools people like, such as React.</p><h2 id=authenticating-to-web-sites>Authenticating to Web Sites</h2><p>One feature that people have been asking for since we started the project has been the ability
to authenticate to a web site. Previously, you could do this by crafting the URL the browser
went to properly, but this leaks credentials to any man-in-the-middle and leaves them in server
logs, so browsers have slowly removed this piece of functionality. That’s unfortunate, since
it’s something that we know people frequently need to do in their tests. In Selenium 4, we
now offer a mechanism to register a username and password that can be used to authenticate against these sites.</p><h2 id=intercepting-network-traffic>Intercepting Network Traffic</h2><p>A common complaint of Selenium tests is that they’re slow and flaky. While the bindings to the
browser are excellent, and fully described by the W3C WebDriver spec, it is true that any end-to-end
test is likely to suffer more flakiness than a simple unit test—there are just more moving parts,
and more possibilities for things to go wrong.</p><p>One way to resolve this issue is to stub out the backend of the application, intercepting network
traffic in the test and returning pre-canned responses. Tools such as <a href=http://www.mbtest.org>mountebank</a>
make this easy for API testing. Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a similar tool for Selenium?</p><p>With Selenium 4, we now provide a mechanism to do this, using the NetworkInterceptor (well, that’s
what we call it in the Java bindings). Pass it your WebDriver instance, and it’ll be called every time
the browser is about to make an HTTP request, allowing you to return almost anything you want</p><h2 id=the-chrome-debugging-protocol>The Chrome Debugging Protocol</h2><p>As I mentioned previously, one of the nice things about Selenium 4 is our work to ensure a stable
and modern user-facing API. What does this mean? To start, we need to acknowledge that after a long
time there’s now competition back in the browser automation space. Notably in the form of Puppeteer
and Cypress, and taking a step back, what do they offer? They build upon the
<a href=https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/>Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)</a>>, which is a
protocol developed to enable a debugger inside Chromium-based browsers.</p><p>Because of what it was designed to do, it is a chatty protocol, and not a user-facing API that
allows you to introspect into the browser. Worse, introduce a network hop between the test and the
browser, this chattiness leads to slower tests as the network latency increases. That is why tools
such as Puppeteer want you to run on the local machine. That’s great for the speed of an individual
test, but makes parallelisation harder, as you can&rsquo;t use services such as Sauce Labs easily.</p><p>To complicate matters, because the CDP is designed as a <em>debugging</em> protocol, it can change with no
notice between versions. That’s why Puppeteer and Cypress are tied to specific versions of browsers,
and that causes a dilemma for you as a test author: how do you test on multiple versions of a browser?
Updating the test API to get a different browser can lead to you no longer making valid API calls.
Not doing so ties you to a potentially outdated version of a browser.</p><p>Despite this, using the CDP opens up a host of possibilities, and that’s why we’ve added support
for it in Selenium 4. In fact, some of our new features are built on top of it (though we hide the details!)</p><p>But we’ve also gone further that just adding basic support. Selenium 4 can support multiple versions
of the CDP at the same time, meaning you can test with both the current and beta versions of Chromium-based
browsers without needing to rewrite tests. We do this by providing an “idealised CDP”, which is
stable and covers the features we feel tests need. If that idealised view of the world isn’t enough
for you, we also expose the raw CDP APIs too, giving you flexibility to choose what’s best for your tests.</p><p>We’re feeding this experience into the new W3C WebDriver Bidi specification, which is helping make that
a better fit for testers.</p><p>I am leaving out of this post all the details related to another important trick in Selenium 4, the new
Selenium Grid, which I will cover in the next post. Stay tuned!</p><p><em>This was originally posted at <a href=https://saucelabs.com/blog/new-tricks-in-selenium-4>https://saucelabs.com/blog/new-tricks-in-selenium-4</a></em></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-c48feeed2ee3208a63c5736d13b489f1>Public Project Meeting - December 03, 2020</h1><div class=lead>Continuing the series of bi-weekly public project meetings&mldr;</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Sri Harsha (<a href=https://twitter.com/sri_harsha509>@sri_harsha509</a>)</b> |

I haven&rsquo;t looked in past 2 weeks, but Ruby & .NET needs to implement FF Full Page screenshot,
Java (.NET?) need to be able to tell Firefox to take a full Page Screenshot when using RemoteWebDriver
Java & Ruby need to re-fix the STP browser name</p><p>Ruby stuff was on my to-do list, until my paid work job gave me a daunting task with a short timeline</p><p><em>Jim Evans 7:04 PM</em></p><p>.NET hasn’t added print-to-pdf yet.</p><p>nor full-page screenshot.</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 7:06 PM</em></p><p>on that note @barancev I couldn&rsquo;t duplicate the Ruby Remote Firefox bug on Mac, and VirtualBox appears to be a disaster running on Mac because I can&rsquo;t even get it to play nicely with a Linux install to test it there. NET read timeout is often a random network problem, but it looks like we&rsquo;ve been seeing the error consistently, so I&rsquo;m concerned about it being a real problem. @p0deje do you have a linux machine available to see if we can replicate locally?</p><p><em>Alex Rodionov 9:35 PM</em></p><p>@titusfortner Not really and frankly I don’t have spare time to set it up to investigate</p><p>Speaking of which, I’ll be leaving for a 1 month road trip next week and I won’t be able to do any Selenium work during that time.

I should be more available in January to help, but I&rsquo;ve spent more time with the Selenium java code than Ruby code recently, so I&rsquo;m not sure how we have the DevTools stuff implemented.
@twalpole what&rsquo;s your availability this month? :-D</p><p><em>David Burns 9:49 PM</em>
do we have people to do releases for ruby with @p0deje away?</p><p><em>Alex Rodionov 9:50 PM</em></p><p>According to <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/8168>https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/8168</a>, a currently missing CDP stuff in Ruby is:
Intercept network requests allowing to mock backend requests
Bootstrap script
Record traffic
The first two I believe are implemented in Java so it should not be hard to redo it in Ruby. I might give it a shot this weekend.
The latter I think is missing in all bindings.
@titusfortner we can hop on pairing session and I’ll guide you through the code.

(they only happen monthly)</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:20 PM</em></p><p>Most of those things are in the project plan, @diemol</p><p><em>Jim Evans 10:21 PM</em></p><p>so there’s a bug in .NET alpha7 that prevents the bindings from working with grid 4.
(it’s fixed now)</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:21 PM</em></p><p>I mentioned recently that Java & Ruby don&rsquo;t have the right STP name still in 4 alpha and .NET & Ruby both

@titusfortner good point. The STP thing is irksome.

with .NET 5 being out, it should be a fair sight easier.</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:27 PM</em></p><p>We can spread the word about the help we need in the different bindings,
either for refactoring or reaching feature parity if we have those changes described somewhere,

what it should be is abstract class WebDriver (implements IWebDriver) -> RemoteWebDriver,
and also abstract WebDriver -> browser specific drivers. if i’m clever about it, this will not be a breaking API change,
because IWebDriver is still A Thing™.</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:28 PM</em></p><p>Just like the java 8 issue was</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:29 PM</em></p><p>Please share, @AutomatedTester</p><p><em>Jim Evans 10:30 PM</em></p><p>my ${paidWork} project is approaching a bit of stability,

I would like to, with support of this group, see about creating a Yak Day.
The idea is, and it requires a bit of upfront work, to get issues in place for this and then see if we can get contributors</p><p><em>Jim Evans 10:31 PM</em></p><p>the idea in Selenium 5 is to start phasing out the
use of IWebDriver in favor of using the abstract base class.</p><p><em>David Burns 10:32 PM</em></p><p>it would also require that I, or others, do a &ldquo;How to contribute&rdquo; video to share before hand</p><p><em>Jim Evans 10:32 PM</em></p><p>(sorry for the parallel idea-spewing into the channel, but i’ve been thinking about this,
and not really talked about it to anyone outside the multiple voices in my own head.)</p><p><em>David Burns 10:32 PM</em></p><p>and if we split it accordingly to language bindings and services we can see if we can try build out a bit more support for each langauge
and may get us more contributors.</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:33 PM</em></p><p>There’ll be hoops I need to jump through, but I can jump through them to make that happen</p><p><em>David Burns 10:33 PM</em></p><p>I appreciate it can flood us with junk and we would need to work out to how to prevent that</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:33 PM</em></p><p>I’ve got some half-written docs for building with bazel for selenium.dev too</p><p><em>David Burns 10:33 PM</em></p><p>but the general gist is create tiny bits of work to build up contributors</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:34 PM</em></p><p>So, I don&rsquo;t know what everything that is on the lists mentioned above entails,
but I do want to put in a generic plug that we make sure things absolutely need to be in 4.0.
If we can release something &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; to iterate on through 4.x releases,
it&rsquo;s going to be *much better than a super polished codebase that isn&rsquo;t released for another 6 months.</p><p><em>Diego Molina 10:34 PM</em></p><p>that would be really great</p><p><em>David Burns 10:35 PM</em></p><p>I agree @titusfortner, while we are in alpha we have a limited usage group
but we have finite resources so its a fine line to tread</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 10:36 PM</em></p><p>nope, totally understand; we&rsquo;re all volunteers and such.
just requesting we keep in mind that perfect is the enemy of releasing something that makes current users lives better</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:36 PM</em></p><p>After 4.0 ships, I’m going to be stepping away

but that&rsquo;s an aside</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 10:39 PM</em></p><p>@jimevans I want to see better .net support in bazel
What I need is a) time, b) a Windows machine</p><p><em>Jim Evans 10:40 PM</em></p><p>well some languages’ tooling are more opinionated than others.

So, recently @AutomatedTester & me got access to the project to release Java, but in general,
if we ever need to do a release and the key folks are missing
we do not have access to this information</p><p><em>Jim Evans 10:45 PM</em>
anyone who wants access to the nuget repo, create a nuget.org account (requires a “microsoft account”), and let me know.

One thing I think I should clear up is &ldquo;why the major version number bump?&rdquo;</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Simon Stewart (<a href=https://twitter.com/shs96c>@shs96c</a>)</b> |
<time datetime=2020-11-10 class=text-body-secondary>Tuesday, November 10, 2020</time></div><blockquote><p>In the second post in this series, Simon Stewart continues talking about
what&rsquo;s coming in Selenium 4 and why this release has a major version bump.</p></blockquote><p>In my <a href=/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-how-can-i-contribute/>last post</a>,
I shared a bit about how the Selenium project works overall. Now, let’s start talking about Selenium 4
and what’s coming. One thing I think I should clear up is &ldquo;why the major version number bump?&rdquo;</p><p>Sometimes I joke that the major reason for the version number bump is that while the digits of Pi are
infinite, when we went from 3.14 to 3.141, people got a little bit upset. Moving to 3.141.5 and then
3.141.59 was as far as we wanted to push that particular idea :)</p><p>More seriously, the first reason is that we have a revised Selenium IDE. Years ago, this used to be
Firefox only because it used the XPI extension mechanism (which was specific to Firefox). It’s now a
web component, and you can download it for Chrome, Firefox, and anything else that supports Web
Components. There is currently work to rewrite it as an Electron app, which will allow us to make
better use of the native OS the IDE is running on. That work was largely pushed forward by developers
working at Applitools. They started from a base of the original Selenium IDE that had been migrated
to use Web Components by a company called SideX. It’s been a fantastic example of the community
working together well.</p><p>Secondly, we have fully adopted the W3C WebDriver protocol, and have dropped support for the original
home-grown wire protocol. The way that Selenium communicates with a web browser is via a wire protocol
that’s effectively just JSON over HTTP. Originally this grew organically as we figured things out,
and we tried to make browsers do what we needed them to. That original protocol is known as the JSON
wire protocol because it spoke JSON over the wire (and we’re not great at coming up with very original names).</p><p>That original protocol was the base for the W3C WebDriver protocol, which smoothed some of the rough
edges, and brought some much needed consistency to the protocol. The two major areas the standardised
protocol improved on included session creation, where we removed considerable ambiguity, and by providing
a far richer API for specifying user actions.</p><p>So what does this adoption of the W3C protocol mean for you? I&rsquo;ll be honest: it probably doesn’t mean
much to you at all. If you&rsquo;re using a modern browser (released over the past couple of years), you will
find that actually you already speak the W3C protocol with Selenium 3.</p><p>So who does care about the protocol dialects? When we talk about companies like Sauce Labs who provide
Selenium as a service—they care about it. The ecosystem is ready for this next step, because the
technical folks at these companies have ensured that they understand and comply with the W3C protocol,
and folks from the Selenium project have been there offering help and advice as needed.</p><p>One of the other nice things about Selenium 4 is that we&rsquo;ve done our best to ensure a stable user-facing
API. That means when you upgrade your project from Selenium 3 to Selenium 4, it should be a drop-in
upgrade. You just change the version number, recompile and you should be done.</p><p>There are a few caveats that you should be aware of, however! The major one is that if in the last version
of Selenium 3 a method was deprecated, it’s now probably gone. We’ve taken the opportunity of a major
version bump to delete them and clean up the behind-the-scenes internals people don’t normally get to see.
If you’re a software developer, you may recognise this as us paying off some of our technical debt :)</p><p>Stay tuned for the next post, where I’ll go over some new tricks in Selenium 4.</p><p><em>This was originally posted at <a href=https://saucelabs.com/blog/whats-coming-in-selenium-4-why-the-major-version-bump>https://saucelabs.com/blog/whats-coming-in-selenium-4-why-the-major-version-bump</a></em></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-0e77969febff716cea560457dafa41f0>What’s Coming in Selenium 4: How Can I Contribute?</h1><div class=lead>As the lead of the Selenium project, I wanted to kick off a new blog series leading up to the release of Selenium 4.</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Simon Stewart (<a href=https://twitter.com/shs96c>@shs96c</a>)</b> |
<time datetime=2020-11-02 class=text-body-secondary>Monday, November 02, 2020</time></div><blockquote><p>In this new blog series all about the upcoming release of Selenium 4, Simon Stewart will
cover how the Selenium project works, who is involved, how you can get involved, and a
sneak peek at what’s new in Selenium 4.</p></blockquote><p>As the lead of the Selenium project, I wanted to kick off a new blog series leading up to
the release of Selenium 4. During this series, I’ll talk all about how the Selenium project
works, who is involved, how you—yes, you!—can get involved, and we’ll get a sneak peek at
what’s new in Selenium 4. I&rsquo;ve been speaking about this off and on for a while, but now
the 4.0 release is looming I wanted to start sharing in more depth.</p><p>In this first post, we’ll start off with a brief discussion about how the Selenium project
itself runs and who does what, because that’s a really helpful piece to understand how and
why things happen the way they do on the project. In future posts, we’ll look at the new IDE,
and then we’ll talk about Selenium 4 in more depth, including the fact that it should be a
drop-in replacement for you. I’ll also review some new features that we’ve added to Selenium
4, and talk a bit about the modernized Selenium Grid. So let’s get started!</p><h2 id=about-the-selenium-project>About the Selenium Project</h2><p>Selenium is an Open Source project. It&rsquo;s run under the aegis of the Software Freedom
Conservancy (SFC). The SFC is a group dedicated to pushing forward Free and Open Source
software. Besides Selenium, they have a handful of projects you may have heard of, including
Samba, Mercurial and Git. The SFC allows us to focus on writing code and fixing bugs by
handling all the legal and financial stuff we’re not good at. They’re the ones that help
us negotiate contracts for when we want to run SeleniumConf, for example.</p><p>Acting as a bridge between the project and the SFC is the Project Leadership Committee
(PLC). Currently, it’s made up of Jim Evans, Alexei Barantsev, Marcus Merrell, Manoj Kumar,
and myself. What do we do? Effectively, the PLC is about providing a smaller group of people
for the SFC to talk to when decisions need to be made about funding a conference, or how
best to respond to sponsorship agreements. Because we like to do as much work in the open
as possible, you can find us on the <code>#selenium-plc</code> Slack channel, and almost every
conversation and topic is discussed here.</p><p>One of the key qualifications for being on the PLC is a demonstrated commitment to helping
the Selenium project improve and succeed, and we recognise that the project is more than just
“code.” It’s a community, and the make up of the PLC reflects that.</p><p>The Technical Leadership Committee (TLC) includes the people who set the technical direction
for the project. If you come over to the Selenium Slack, you can find the <code>#selenium-tlc</code> channel,
which is where a lot of the technical conversations happen for the project. The TLC includes Jim
Evans, Alexei Barantsev, David Burns, Diego Molina, Titus Fortner, and me.</p><p>How do you get on the TLC? Although the project governance document goes into more detail,
it can be summed up as simply as someone who’s demonstrated technical leadership on the project,
over an extended period of time. Just as with the PLC, being on the TLC doesn’t give someone more
authority, but they’re the ones who can merge PRs, and who can (if need be) commit directly to the tree.</p><p>Again, the TLC tries to do as much work as possible in the open. If you’re ever interested in watching
the design discussions, or asking why a bit of the Selenium code base is structured the way it is, then
come and join us in the <code>#selenium-tlc</code> Slack channel. There’s normally someone from the project there
who’ll be able to answer your questions!</p><p>I wanted to share how the project works for one simple reason: to highlight one of the really important
things with Open Source, which is that anyone can contribute! You don&rsquo;t need to be throwing code around
in order to be contributing, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-BfM97PZk">you don’t need to be special</a>
in order to contribute your time and effort.</p><p>So obviously there&rsquo;s the people running the projects and writing code, but we couldn&rsquo;t do that all on our own.
Every release includes contributions from a variety of people, not just the core development team. Also, we&rsquo;re
always happy to accept patches. If you&rsquo;re not quite sure where to start, I recommend you head to our
<a href=https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/>GitHub page</a> and take a look at the project tab. That’s where you
can see the things that need to be done and what we&rsquo;re working on.</p><p>The other way to get involved is the way that everyone used to get involved with Open Source, which is by
what&rsquo;s known as “scratching your own itch”. It&rsquo;s if there&rsquo;s something about the project, something about the
product you think could be a little bit better, download the source, edit it, and then send us a PR.</p><p>We encourage you to get involved and contribute! On the Selenium website, there is a
<a href=https://www.selenium.dev/governance/>page</a> that outlines in detail the steps to join the Selenium team.
Join the Selenium Slack channel to interact with us and ask questions. If you want to discuss something,
or if you don&rsquo;t understand why the code is written the way it is, feel free to come on to that Slack channel
and talk to us. Also, if you&rsquo;d like to see how the decision making is made, then please do feel free to come
on to the <code>#selenium-tlc</code> or the <code>#selenium-plc</code> channels to see those groups. Because we&rsquo;re Open Source, we
try and do everything in the open.</p><p>If you’d like to put faces to people’s Slack or IRC handles, then please note that there’s a regular team
meeting every other Thursday on Google Meet at 4:30pm (UK time!) We tend to just chat and discuss everything
from the project to the weather, but that’s a great way to get to know people a little better! :)</p><p>Finally, if you’re having trouble getting to grips with the Selenium code base, then please do come and ask us
for help. We’ve done our best to make the on-ramp as easy to take as possible, but the project can seem complicated
and daunting when you’re getting started. We’re here to help!</p><p>I hope you enjoyed this intro to the Selenium project. Next week, we’ll talk about why the major version bump to
Selenium 4. Stay tuned!</p><p><em>This was originally posted at <a href=https://saucelabs.com/blog/whats-coming-in-selenium-4-how-can-i-contribute>https://saucelabs.com/blog/whats-coming-in-selenium-4-how-can-i-contribute</a></em></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-572a737e6a1abb38f8f0330fa4823975>Browser Testing and Tools WG Meeting @ TPAC 2020</h1><div class=lead>Browser Testing and Tools WG Meeting @ TPAC 2020</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>David Burns (<a href=https://twitter.com/AutomatedTester>@AutomatedTester</a>)</b> |

<time datetime=2020-09-30 class=text-body-secondary>Wednesday, September 30, 2020</time></div><figure class=img-responsive><img src=/blog/2020/selenium-conf-2020-recap/featured_selenium_conf_2020_recap_1.png></figure><p>This year the <a href=https://2020.seleniumconf.in/>Selenium Conference</a> was held virtually, and
despite that, the conference was again that exciting place where the Selenium community
meets every year to share and learn about the most popular browser automation tool in the
world. The conference offered talks about improved testing practices, new tools to simplify
the setup of automated tests, the future of Selenium, and lots of learnings from speakers
who shared their use cases and practical advice for how they use Selenium at work.</p><p>Here are some takeaways and interesting talks from this year’s conference:</p><h2 id=selenium-state-of-the-union>Selenium: State of the Union</h2><p>A peek at the upcoming Selenium 4 release was possible thanks to the demo
<a href=https://twitter.com/shs96c>Simon Stewart</a> gave during this traditional
<a href=https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/14020/selenium-state-of-the-union>talk</a>
that happens in every Selenium conference. Selenium 4 is shaping up nicely and will leave
the Alpha state soon. We are all looking forward to the betas, and a candidate release
shortly after that. The talk also invited other members of the Selenium team to share the
organizational work they have been doing in the project, including diversity, governance
and welcoming contributors.</p><figure class="img-responsive my-5"><img src=/blog/2020/selenium-conf-2020-recap/selenium_conf_2020_recap_2.png></figure><h2 id=build-a-responsive-typescript-wdio-framework>Build a responsive typescript wdio framework</h2><p><a href=https://twitter.com/vibranttester>Varuna Srivastava</a> gave a
<a href=https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/13629/build-a-responsive-typescript-wdio-framework>talk</a>
together with <a href=https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/13629/build-a-responsive-typescript-wdio-framework>Wim Selles</a>
that showed how to build a robust and scalable framework for UI testing, based on WebdriverIO.
It showed concepts that are important when getting started with JavaScript, NodeJS, and the NPM
ecosystem. Furthermore, there was a broad overview of WebdriverIO and its shiny features, as well
as a demo on how to use TypeScript for testing. This is a recommended talk for anyone who wants to
get started on testing with JavaScript.</p><figure class="img-responsive my-5"><img src=/blog/2020/selenium-conf-2020-recap/selenium_conf_2020_recap_3.png></figure><h2 id=to-test-and-monitor-one-website-is-not-that-hard-but-what-if-you-need-to-do-it-to-over-40-websites>To Test and monitor one website is not that hard, but what if you need to do it to over 40 websites?</h2><p>This was an interesting <a href=https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/schedule>talk</a> from
<a href=https://twitter.com/qa_jesus>Jesus Sanchez</a>, where in order to avoid having the QA department as
a bottleneck for the growing team of developers, they took the approach of building tools and resources
for developers and enabling them to write tests for their over 40 websites. It is an interesting take
on how the QA role becomes a facilitator and an enabler for the rest of the organization, while
coaching everyone on how to write automated tests and the value of testing the right thing.</p><figure class="img-responsive my-5"><img src=/blog/2020/selenium-conf-2020-recap/selenium_conf_2020_recap_4.png></figure><h2 id=careers-in-testing--identify-your-superpower>Careers in Testing – Identify your SuperPower</h2><p><a href=https://twitter.com/smitapmishra>Smita Mishra</a> gave a
<a href=https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/13771/careers-in-testing-identify-your-superpower>captivating</a>
talk where she invited all testers to think what alternative paths could be present in their careers,
given that some organizations value testing more than others. Smita showed that if you understand what
you enjoy the most, and find a way to combine that with your current and future skills, it could show
you how to grow your career by finding and following a path of the least resistance.</p><figure class="img-responsive my-5"><img src=/blog/2020/selenium-conf-2020-recap/selenium_conf_2020_recap_5.png></figure><h2 id=developing-selenium-tests-with-junit-5>Developing Selenium tests with JUnit 5</h2><p>JUnit 5 is the new iteration of this popular testing framework, and it implements a new programming
and extension model named Jupiter. <a href=https://twitter.com/boni_gg>Boni García</a> presents in this
<a href=https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/13255/developing-selenium-tests-with-junit-5>talk</a>
a JUnit 5 extension called <a href=https://bonigarcia.github.io/selenium-jupiter/>Selenium-Jupiter</a>,
the demos showed illustrate how useful this extension is because it simplifies the test configuration
and reduces the boilerplate code that needs to be written in order to have a test running. Have a
look at it because it is well maintained and documented, and it will help you by reducing the time
needed to set up your tests.</p><figure class="img-responsive my-5"><img src=/blog/2020/selenium-conf-2020-recap/selenium_conf_2020_recap_6.png></figure><h2 id=im-not-special>I&rsquo;m Not Special</h2><p>One of the <a href=https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/14005/im-not-special>keynotes</a> in
the conference was done by <a href=https://twitter.com/jimevansmusic>Jim Evans</a>, where he relates a
personal journey through his career and how clearly “not special” he considers himself. One of
the key takeaways is the fact that you become a major contributor and you do not need to be special
to do that. No review will make enough justice to highlight how heartwarming and encouraging this
talk was, it is a must watch for anyone who wants to become a contributor.</p><figure class="img-responsive my-5"><img src=/blog/2020/selenium-conf-2020-recap/selenium_conf_2020_recap_7.png></figure><h2 id=closing-keynote>Closing keynote</h2><p>The final session of the conference was the
<a href=https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2020/proposal/14836/q-a-with-the-selenium-committee>keynote</a>
where the project committers do an open Q&amp;A with the community. Different opinions were shared around
the question of the challenges the Selenium project sees by the growing number of browser automation
tools. In addition, all project contributors made an open invitation to the community to get involved
in the project, if you are interested in that, please check the project’s
<a href=https://www.selenium.dev/governance/>governance document</a>. This is another recommended session
to watch, lots of insights about how the project and its individuals work that will help the community
understand the project better.</p><figure class="img-responsive my-5"><img src=/blog/2020/selenium-conf-2020-recap/selenium_conf_2020_recap_8.png></figure><p><em>This was originally posted at <a href=https://opensource.saucelabs.com/blog/selenium_conf_2020_recap/>https://opensource.saucelabs.com/blog/selenium_conf_2020_recap/</a></em></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-110d6b0678eac15720203b23df9df0da>Public Project Meeting - September 24, 2020</h1><div class=lead>Continuing the series of bi-weekly public project meetings&mldr;</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Sri Harsha (<a href=https://twitter.com/sri_harsha509>@sri_harsha509</a>)</b> |

Pending work that needs to be done for Alpha 7?</p><p><em>Jim Evans:black_medium_square: 9:06 PM</em>
.NET needs a fair bit of refactor for CDP
i’m planning on taking all day tomorrow to look at that.</p><p><em>David Burns 9:07 PM</em></p><p>Oh that&rsquo;s awesome</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:07 PM</em></p><p>The java code is in a releasable state, I think

It’d be nice if those were in other languages too</p><p><em>David Burns 9:10 PM</em></p><p>but&mldr; feature wise after that we&rsquo;re done right?
I&rsquo;m itching to get us out of alpha
we&rsquo;re not getting enough usage</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:10 PM</em></p><p>I think we’re basically there once it’s done
How’s the UI looking?</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:11 PM</em></p><p>Sounds like it, for Alpha 7, to summarise:
CDP working across bindings
Session queue in Grid</p><p><em>David Burns 9:11 PM</em></p><p>the UI is there, I think. We&rsquo;ve fixed the main UI issues</p><p><em>Jim Evans:black_medium_square: 9:11 PM</em></p><p>i agree with that assessment. once CDP work for .NET is done, i’m considering it feature-complete for 4.x.</p><p><em>David Burns 9:11 PM</em></p><p>and that&rsquo;s all in trunk</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:13 PM</em></p><p>Great, I am not sure if there is anything else to add to the topic</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:13 PM</em></p><p>Other than a proposed date to release a7?</p><p><em>David Burns 9:13 PM</em></p><p>next week (no pressure everyone)</p><p><em>Jim Evans:black_medium_square: 9:14 PM</em></p><p>wednesday or after of next week. i’m sure i’m not going to get it all done in one day.</p><p><em>David Burns 9:14 PM</em></p><p>Thursday and Fridays are our normal release dates so that sounds good</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:14 PM</em></p><p>I’m going to make a decision to gate the release on @jimevans saying that .Net is ready to roll</p><p><em>Jim Evans:black_medium_square: 9:14 PM</em></p><p>to quote @AutomatedTester “no pressure” :slightly_smiling_face:
we’re putting a stake in the ground saying a7 is our last alpha?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:15 PM</em></p><p>With a hard stop-date of 2020-10-07
For java, yes
And I think we have the most moving parts</p><p><em>Jim Evans:black_medium_square: 9:15 PM</em></p><p>(agreed as a7 being last alpha for .NET too)</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:17 PM</em></p><p>Any comments from other bindings?
@AutomatedTester @titusfortner @rajendra @harsha509?</p><p><em>David Burns 9:17 PM</em></p><p>I want us out of alpha
so&mldr;</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:17 PM</em></p><p>@AutomatedTester we all want to be out of alpha</p><p><em>Rajendra Kadam 9:17 PM</em></p><p>working out for js, some tests issues, trying to fix those</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:17 PM</em></p><p>But we also don’t want to move “just because”</p><p><em>Sri Harsha 9:18 PM</em></p><p>JS is already in alpha 7, can we release JS npm with like alpha7-patch1 with CDP ?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:18 PM</em></p><p>Bump JS to alpha8
Keep it simple :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Sri Harsha 9:19 PM</em></p><p>ok, Thank you @simonstewart</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:21 PM</em></p><p>Does it make sense to discuss the next topic? “Betas”</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:22 PM</em></p><p>We can move on from “alphas” :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:22 PM</em></p><p>Like, having a timeline or something like that for Betas?</p><p><em>David Burns 9:22 PM</em></p><p>There are a number of issues that are &ldquo;assigned&rdquo; in the &ldquo;in Progress&rdquo; part of <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/projects/2>https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/projects/2</a>
I think understanding which of those features are needed for use to move through the betas is important</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:23 PM</em></p><p>I have a pile of branches locally with changes
If it’s in the 4.0 roadmap, that kind of suggests it’s needed before release
If it’s not in the roadmap, we don’t need to worry about it
(For the release itself)
(We do need to worry about it)</p><p><em>David Burns 9:24 PM</em></p><p>so&mldr; I guess my request is, if you&rsquo;re doing it, what can we do to get it sorted (like hand off to someone else) or if you&rsquo;ve not started can you unassign yourself
I think it would be good to get a clearer picture of where people can help</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:25 PM</em></p><p>I’m not actually assigned to that much</p><p><em>David Burns 9:25 PM</em></p><p>this is a comment to all of us really</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:25 PM</em></p><p>One code review, one “add support for retries to handlers”
I’ve a local change that has the skeleton of retries written, as well as fallback URLs for commands</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:27 PM</em></p><p>I’ve seen that one and wanted to check, but time hasn’t been on my side lately</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:27 PM</em></p><p>Join the club :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>David Burns 9:28 PM</em></p><p>so part of my request really is knowing where I can help without having to badger you all
I being me and my team</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:29 PM</em></p><p>Getting Grid rock solid would be really helpful
I suspect we’re not really using ZMQ properly
And if that falls over, we’re in trouble</p><p><em>David Burns 9:31 PM</em></p><p>we&rsquo;ve engaged @adamgoucher and he seems Ok, but this is where I want to get more usage from betas
and the grid is pretty solid
we&rsquo;ve fixed the main issues from browserstack at least</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:32 PM</em></p><p>One thing I’d quite like is a way to hook in SaaS providers to the Grid</p><p><em>David Burns 9:32 PM</em></p><p>and I would love to get a new alpha out so we can start using Jaegar more</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:33 PM</em></p><p>The Docker support also needs some work
Firebase support and XRay would be nice for use in GCP and AWS
Our HTTP client needs work: I don’t think reactor is really going to work for us</p><p><em>9:34</em></p><p>Every time I try and switch to it, there’s Yet Another Weird Failure</p><p><em>David Burns 9:35 PM</em></p><p>I am happy to get Puja involved here</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:36 PM</em></p><p>I think one thing we’d really love to demo is “deploying Grid to EKS” and seeing it start outputting information
@Puja Jagani’s help would be amazing</p><p><em>Puja Jagani 9:36 PM</em></p><p>Would love to help!</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:36 PM</em></p><p>Awesomeness :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:36 PM</em></p><p>we can do that, it should not be hard :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:37 PM</em></p><p>Getting a Kafka version of EventBus would allow folks to use other hosted infra, but I think that may be too much for 4.0</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:39 PM</em></p><p>I prefer to see the Gird being rock solid at its core, and when that is the case, add the other things</p><p><em>David Burns 9:39 PM</em></p><p>augementing things like that is a definite post 4.0 item</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:39 PM</em></p><p>for example, I would say we can tackle the redis backed distributor after the release</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:40 PM</em></p><p>I’m working on some changes to make the state of the distributor serializable
Once those are done, I’ll be a lot happier with it</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:43 PM</em></p><p>Great, I think those are the topics for today, is there something else?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:44 PM</em></p><p>Not from me</p><p><em>David Burns 9:44 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m done</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:45 PM</em></p><p>Thanks everyone!</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:45 PM</em>

<time datetime=2020-08-27 class=text-body-secondary>Thursday, August 27, 2020</time></div><figure class="img-responsive text-center"><img src=/blog/2020/how_to_delete_your_master_branch/featured_how_to_delete_your_master_branch_2.png></figure><p>At the Selenium project we practice
<a href=https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/>trunk based development</a>, in which <code>trunk</code> is the
usual name of the default git branch of the repository. However, when the project was
moved to GitHub, the repository followed the traditional use of <code>master</code> as a name for
the default git branch.</p><p>With the intention of making the Selenium project an even more inclusive place where
everyone is welcome, a decision was made to use <code>trunk</code> as the default git branch and,
after the switch, delete the <code>master</code> branch. This change created a few challenges.
This blog post will point out a few things you should watch out if you want to make
the same change in your GitHub repository.</p><h4 id=broken-links>Broken Links</h4><p>It is common to link specific parts of the code in the documentation, and that link
normally contains the branch name. Double-check your documentation for links pointing
to files living on the <code>master</code> branch, as they could end up as broken links after
the change.</p><h4 id=mentions-to-the-branch-name>Mentions to the branch name</h4><p>Similarly, the branch name gets mentioned in different parts of the repository,
such as code comments, contribution instructions, issue and pull request templates,
and the readme. Don’t forget to check these places.</p><h4 id=github-repository-badges>GitHub repository badges</h4><p>We all like to show off how our GitHub repository is doing by adding as many badges
as we can. In many cases, those badges report a build status that depends on the branch
where the build was executed. Make sure your Travis/CircleCI/GitHub Actions badge is
pointing to the new branch.</p><h4 id=continuous-integration-setups>Continuous Integration setups</h4><p>A good practice in open source is to have a continuous integration setup to run the
builds, execute tests and potentially do automated releases. Nowadays, the CI
configuration is done in files (e.g. .travis.yml for Travis), and one important
piece of that configuration is the name of the branch where the build should be
executed. Similar to the previous point, double check that your new branch name
is property configured in your CI integration.</p><h4 id=build-scripts>Build scripts</h4><p>At the Selenium project, we have a few custom build scripts that get executed
through the continuous integration setup. An example is the script that generates
the docs for the Java, Ruby and Python bindings. This script needs to know the code’s
branch name to generate the docs. If you have scripts with similar purposes, check
them after changing the branch name.</p><h4 id=open-pull-requests>Open pull requests</h4><p>All of the tasks above could probably be achieved with a text editor and a massive,
but careful, “search and replace” across all the files in the repository. In short,
the process we followed to move to the new branch <code>trunk</code> was:</p><ol><li>Create a new branch called <code>trunk</code>, based on the <code>master</code> branch.</li><li>Do all the items described in the previous points.</li><li>Commit and push those changes.</li><li>Delete the <code>master</code> branch.</li></ol><p>Nevertheless, one thing happened that we did not expect: after deleting the <code>master</code>
branch, all the open pull requests got closed. This made sense, since they were all
targeting the <code>master</code> branch. Therefore, before deleting your <code>master</code> branch, double
check and, if needed, edit the open pull requests so they target the new branch.</p><figure class="img-responsive text-center"><img src=/blog/2020/how_to_delete_your_master_branch/how_to_delete_your_master_branch_1.png></figure><p>It goes without saying that the name of your new branch can be any name that works
well for your context and environment. For example, the

General project statistics (Previous meeting: 338 open issues, 73 open PRs)</p><p><em>8:01 PM</em></p><p>Current statistics 334 open issues, 63 open PRs
Next item
Overall announcements? New people on committees, with the commit bit, etc?
Not that I am aware, anyone else?</p><p><em>David Burns 8:02 PM</em></p><p>No, but I would like to propose to create a new team on github for my team to at least have triage ability on bugs</p><p><em>8:03 PM</em></p><p>I can&rsquo;t assign bugs unless they are somehow associated to the org</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:03 PM</em></p><p>That is a good idea, I had the thought of creating a triage team and add people who are helping already in the #selenium channel, like @Salmon Mode
:+1:</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:03 PM</em></p><p>+1 for a triage team</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:04 PM</em></p><p>We should add that to the governance model</p><p><em>David Burns 8:04 PM</em></p><p>we can always discuss commit bit for my team at a later stage but I want them in the org</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:04 PM</em></p><p>as a way to be part of the team without the need of explicitly be a committer</p><p><em>8:05 PM</em></p><p>who wants to take that task? add this to the governance model?</p><p><em>David Burns 8:05 PM</em></p><p>I can</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:05 PM</em></p><p>:thumbsup:</p><p><em>8:06 PM</em></p><p>next topic?
Improving workflow (Reviewing PRs, Improving design requirements)</p><p><em>David Burns 8:06 PM</em></p><p>that&rsquo;s mine</p><p><em>8:07 PM</em></p><p>I would like to see if there is a way we can get designs for what people want descrribed better in issues
I have noticed people misinterpretting requests in bugs that my team are working on</p><p><em>8:08 PM</em></p><p>and I dont know if it&rsquo;s tribal knowledge that is missing or general experience or what
can we get more definitive process for this</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:08 PM</em></p><p>“misinterpreting”?</p><p><em>David Burns 8:09 PM</em></p><p>well, we started down the observability issue and there are cases where work was done based on what their intrepretation was and it turned out to be different
they didnt have the same context and motivation behind the changes</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:10 PM</em></p><p>It really helped when we had a conversation about the event stuff
And since I’d planned to do that work myself, it seemed more lightweight not to fully describe everything in the issue</p><p><em>David Burns 8:10 PM</em></p><p>I agree, and I want to see if there are times we can front load that in to the issue
rather than go down, write code , it&rsquo;s wrong, try again</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:10 PM</em></p><p>Maybe if we make clear that they’re a placeholder for a conversation
and identify who to speak to?</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:11 PM</em></p><p>what I am missing in general about this, is that the decisions made through conversations in Slack are not being written in the GitHub issues or in the PRs, which makes things hard to review and move on</p><p><em>David Burns 8:11 PM</em></p><p>there is that too</p><p><em>8:12 PM</em></p><p>but having a converrsation requires the person that needs to be spoken to being free which isnt always a realistic expectation due to numerrous factors</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:13 PM</em></p><p>True, but front-loading all the design work is also impractical</p><p><em>David Burns 8:13 PM</em></p><p>I guess if we add more context and motivation that would be a good halfway point</p><p><em>8:13 PM</em></p><p>motivation being the main one for me.</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:13 PM</em></p><p>what we also need to realise is that we did not have something that looked like a roadmap before, Simon helped with his brain dump that turned into the GitHub issues we have for the Selenium 4 release project
so we are in a better place than the one we were
but I agree that more detail on what is intended in the issues is needed, a natural next step in the iteration
:+1:</p><p><em>David Burns 8:14 PM</em></p><p>agreed</p><p><em>8:15 PM</em></p><p>because, and this is my next item, if we can have some more info in issues it&rsquo;s easierr to review
there are changes that I can review and I go for correctness in the java server but it might be the wrong idea
and we have PRs that sit, again due to people having lives and can&rsquo;t always be here</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:16 PM</em></p><p>do you think we should back to the open issues and find ways to extend them and make them more clear?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:17 PM</em></p><p>Select the subset that are needing clarification and ask?</p><p><em>David Burns 8:17 PM</em></p><p>I have started doing that with some of the next load of work that I want my team to work on
my goal, like everyone, is to ship se4</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:17 PM</em></p><p>Agreed
And I want to help make that happen</p><p><em>8:18 PM</em></p><p>But I’m under some weird time constraints</p><p><em>David Burns 8:18 PM</em></p><p>I know, I am not blaming anyone</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:18 PM</em></p><p>I know :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>David Burns 8:18 PM</em></p><p>I just want to make your life easier and my team&rsquo;s
and you&rsquo;re kinda in both</p><p><em>8:19 PM</em></p><p>so&mldr; since code is mutable&mldr; can we go with I review for correctness, if it&rsquo;s wrong and we spot then a new issue is raised with more context/motivation?
and I will put it on my team&rsquo;s stack?</p><p><em>8:20 PM</em></p><p>I feel this issue could raise it&rsquo;s head with Sauce if they expand their team</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:20 PM</em></p><p>uh, I need the simple English translation for that phrase</p><p><em>David Burns 8:21 PM</em></p><p>heh&mldr; sorry
since I can review code, and make sure we have tests. If I feel it&rsquo;s ok to merge I will, after a few days</p><p><em>8:22 PM</em></p><p>if others in this group disagree with the change, let me know, I will add it to our work and will get it sorted
The issue of missing context and motivation could happen to anyone joining this group e.g. Sauce expanding their OSS team</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:24 PM</em></p><p>got it, thanks for the translation
I don’t see any issue with that, I think it makes sense
in the end we can always improve things after merging code</p><p><em>David Burns 8:24 PM</em></p><p>cool. there are a few PRs from my team that have been sitting for a while</p><p><em>8:25 PM</em></p><p>and didn&rsquo;t feel I could merge as I didnt have confidence in the serverr (give me a browser any day)</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:26 PM</em></p><p>I am finding ways to help a bit more there, but we should follow your suggestion, I would appreciate a comment in the PR before merging it, like “hey, this has been sitting for while, it looks correct to me, I’ll merge it tomorrow unless someone has something against”
:+1:</p><p><em>David Burns 8:27 PM</em></p><p>deal
and we can get to a stage where my team can review each other which would be even better</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:27 PM</em></p><p>:thumbsup:</p><p><em>8:28 PM</em></p><p>Next topic?
Selenium Conf website in GitHub org? (README is pending)</p><p><em>8:29 PM</em></p><p>Quick update here, Andrew gave me an intro on how to make changes, the setup is more complex than I thought. We are in the process of documenting it.
We should in the near future formalise a team in the governance model for the Selenium conference, there is a lot of work happening there that should be more recognised
:+1:</p><p><em>8:30 PM</em></p><p>Next topic
IDE to the main repo?</p><p><em>8:30 PM</em></p><p>I’ve seen @AutomatedTester and @rajendra moving the IDE repo into bazel, right?</p><p><em>David Burns 8:31 PM</em></p><p>bazel work is hand
once that is done we can move it over wholesale
I think the bazel work is 40% of packages. Tests still need doing but we&rsquo;re touch the rough edges of bazel here</p><p><em>8:32 PM</em></p><p>we&rsquo;ve both been chatting to people on the bazel slack</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:32 PM</em></p><p>thanks for the update
next topic?</p><p><em>8:33 PM</em></p><p>Users/passwords, access keys, etc… to distribution and release repositories.
I added this one</p><p><em>8:34 PM</em></p><p>A few weeks ago I changed the way docker-selenium is released, moved it to GitHub actions, since I did not know the password used to push the images to Docker Hub, I had to reset the password and use it there</p><p><em>8:35 PM</em></p><p>which means that I am the only one who has the password now, and I believe this is the case for many other things we have (npm, python and ruby stuff, stores for Google/Firefox etc..)
is there a way the ones in the TLC can have access to this information?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:35 PM</em></p><p>We have some of the passwords stored in LastPass</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:35 PM</em></p><p>and also consolidate it?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:36 PM</em></p><p>We can share out individual credentials as needed</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:36 PM</em></p><p>the thing is that the “as needed” moment usually comes when the one who has the credentials is not available</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:37 PM</em></p><p>That’s why we share them on LastPass :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Titus Fortner 8:37 PM</em></p><p>We could create a selenium account for Rubygems and share the password, right now it is giving individual accounts permission manually</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:38 PM</em></p><p>Who has access to LastPass and can give access to all the TLC members?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:38 PM</em></p><p>I do.
Everyone in the PLC should have it too</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:38 PM</em></p><p>I am only referring to credentials needed for releases and so on
do we want to have different types of credentials mixed?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:38 PM</em></p><p>(Sinking into a meeting where I need to talk at work. Dropping out of here)</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:39 PM</em></p><p>Ok, then we can touch this topic again in the next meeting, but we already started it :slightly_smiling_face:
Next topic:
Anything new to report from the last PLC/SFC call?</p><p><em>8:40 PM</em></p><p>Seems not :slightly_smiling_face:
Next topic:
Conferences. Status for SeConf India & SeConf Chicago?</p><p><em>David Burns 8:42 PM</em></p><p>@mmerrell or @manoj9788 ?</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:42 PM</em></p><p>I know India is virtual and there is a schedule already, I think they are figuring out if workshops will be done
:+1::skin-tone-4:</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:43 PM</em></p><p>and I saw that Chicago is officially postponed to 2021</p><p><em>David Burns 8:43 PM</em></p><p>in that case, move this topic to just india and then post that conference drop it from the agenda for a while</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:44 PM</em></p><p>ok, makes sense
next topic:
Pending work that needs to be done for Alpha 7?
Pending work that needs to be done for the first Beta?
I am not sure if there are many updates here</p><p><em>8:44 PM</em></p><p>I think we need to land those PRs that are sitting to move to the last alpha</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:46 PM</em></p><p>Yeah&ndash;we&rsquo;ve moved out all SeConf Chicago meetings until November. We&rsquo;re working to choose a new date with the venue for next year, and working on language in the contract that will allow us &ldquo;ultimate cancel ability&rdquo; if this thing continues to be a problem. We can move that off of the agenda for the time being
:+1:</p><p><em>8:47 PM</em></p><p>I don&rsquo;t have any new information about India - as far as I know there are no changes to the plan</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:48 PM</em></p><p>thanks Marcus!</p><p><em>8:49 PM</em></p><p>So, I know that the 4 remaining topics in the agenda have no updates, so I suggest we skip them and we end the meeting early
what do you think?</p><p><em>David Burns 8:49 PM</em></p><p>fine
@mmerrell hey&mldr; friendly poke about that draining PR</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:51 PM</em></p><p>ok, thanks everyone for your time!</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-fa3a3057db820c9c6955d8ac8791d0ca>Public Project Meeting - July 02, 2020</h1><div class=lead>Continuing the series of bi-weekly public project meetings&mldr;</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Sri Harsha (<a href=https://twitter.com/sri_harsha509>@sri_harsha509</a>)</b> |

Previous meeting: 343 open issues, 72 open PRs

Overall announcements? New people on committees, with the commit bit, etc?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:04 PM</em></p><p>WebDriver BiDi meeting was yesterday. There’s some spec prose</p><p><em>David Burns 8:04 PM</em></p><p>@tourdedave is stepping back from the tlc, for a while at least unless I have misunderstood</p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 8:05 PM</em></p><p>@AutomatedTester stepping into TLC</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:05 PM</em></p><p>I thought he did that a while ago, but we failed to update everything</p><p><em>David Burns 8:05 PM</em></p><p>its more official :)</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:05 PM</em></p><p>do we want to remove him from the list explicitly? does it make a difference?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:05 PM</em></p><p>And @AutomatedTester should have been in the TLC from the start :man-facepalming::skin-tone-2:</p><p>“The list”?

:cake:</p><p><em>8:06</em>

The spec is being driven by Mozilla and Google mostly atm</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:08 PM</em></p><p>thanks for the updates
next topic?
Anything new to report from the last PLC/SFC call?</p><p><em>Luke Hill 8:08 PM</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m just being nosy, nothing to see here.</p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 8:09 PM</em></p><p>Nothing specific from the last PLC/SFC call. We&rsquo;ve caught up on conference updates, which we will cover shortly.</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:10 PM</em></p><p>ok, sounds good
next topic is:
Did anyone talk to Miki about the go bindings?</p><ul><li>This topic has been skipped in the previous meetings
but it is good to keep it on the agenda so we act on it
when we have more bandwidth there is no need to
comment or discuss if no one has updates though</li></ul><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:10 PM</em></p><p>Nothing from me</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:11 PM</em></p><p>ok
the next topic is:
Pending work that needs to be done for Alpha 7?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:11 PM</em></p><p>I’d really like us to get the new UI in place for alpha 7
Even if it’s just a skeleton</p><p><em>David Burns 8:12 PM</em></p><p>That is in flight now, hope to get a demo on Monday and see
what needs to be improved before we move into the repo
:tada:</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:12 PM</em></p><p>Great news :slightly_smiling_face:
Lemme check the project plan</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:12 PM</em></p><p>I have seen CDP in Python and JS are almost there</p><p><em>David Burns 8:12 PM</em></p><p>we already have some of the parts required
in master and the rest are being worked on
CDP in python has landed</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:13 PM</em></p><p><a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/projects/2>https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/projects/2</a></p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 8:13 PM</em></p><p>And GraphQL is nearing completion, I guess.</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:13 PM</em></p><p>Things on my list are the new features based on CDP usage
Pluggable locators</p><p><em>8:14</em></p><p>And CDP/WebDriver interop (mostly at the element and window level)
Those will let us call alpha 7 the final alpha
:tada:
And we can make a start on the betas as we’ll be feature complete
IMO
Anything else that folks can think of?</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:15 PM</em></p><p>nothing else from my side</p><p><em>David Burns 8:15 PM</em></p><p>we do have the beta list at <a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ASelenium-4-Beta">https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ASelenium-4-Beta</a></p><p><em>8:16</em></p><p>do we need to move more things there?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:16 PM</em></p><p>Are those “bugs to fix in the betas” or “bugs to fix before we can cut a beta”?</p><p><em>David Burns 8:16 PM</em>
or remove
yes</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:16 PM</em></p><p>Logically correct, but not an actual answer :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>David Burns 8:16 PM</em></p><p>it&rsquo;s a list of things @diemol thought we needed and I mostly agree</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:17 PM</em></p><p>they come from the Google Doc we went through in London in February with Simon</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:17 PM</em></p><p>I shall ruthlessly reprioritise
Those are things that we mostly need in place before release</p><p><em>8:18</em></p><p>But I think we can go into the betas with “the features are there, but they’re known to be unstable”
The alphas are “the features aren’t even there yet”</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:18 PM</em></p><p>I would expect to have a few things being unstable in the betas</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:19 PM</em></p><p>“A few things” will definitely be unstable</p><p><em>David Burns 8:19 PM</em></p><p>I would like to get things that may have got sorted but
the bug list is out of date sorted as well from our lists</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:20 PM</em></p><p>That list seems mostly up to date</p><p><em>David Burns 8:20 PM</em></p><p>but things like Ruby on bazel and ide in the
mono repo I dont think are Se4 dependent</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:20 PM</em></p><p>I don’t see things that are already fixed in it</p><p><em>David Burns 8:20 PM</em></p><p>my comment was general so people checked :D</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:20 PM</em></p><p>indeed, I usually keep an eye on the issues, and I believe is up to date
btw, we are already covering the next topic in the agenda
Pending work that needs to be done for the first Beta?
:+1::skin-tone-4:</p><p><em>David Burns 8:21 PM</em></p><p>yes and no&mldr;
Can we get PRs in flight finished if they are just waiting on reviews
on fixing review comments I meant</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:22 PM</em></p><p>Which ones in particular?</p><p><em>David Burns 8:22 PM</em></p><p>The draining one and the redis one (not picking on people) come to mind</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:22 PM</em></p><p>I’m not happy landing the Redis one since it leaves a broken
RedisBackedDistributor in the tree, and that’s suboptimal</p><p><em>8:23</em></p><p>I need to re-review the draining one</p><p><em>David Burns 8:23 PM</em></p><p>I am not saying we need to fix it but we need people to finish them off :)</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:23 PM</em></p><p>Indeed.</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:25 PM</em></p><p>so, is there anything else to add before moving to the next one?</p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 8:25 PM</em></p><p>Selenium IDE work is a separate topic? Unsure if @corevo is here?
I meant on the Electron piece of work.</p><p><em>David Burns 8:25 PM</em></p><p>I can field that&mldr;</p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 8:25 PM</em></p><p>great!</p><p><em>David Burns 8:26 PM</em></p><p>Selenium IDE is now in the Edge store

Selenium Conf website in GitHub org?
@andrewmkrug did a great job in revamping the site weeks ago, and now the
code is in a private repo under the SeleniumHQ GitHub org he&rsquo;ll add some
instructions to the README on how to develop on it and deploy it
:clap::skin-tone-4:</p><p><em>8:34</em></p><p>the repo is private just to keep information about future
conferences confidential :slightly_smiling_face:
next topic:
IDE to the main repo?</p><p><em>David Burns 8:35 PM</em></p><p>No change on this. I hope to get to it soon,
I have a branch doing the Bazel work</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:35 PM</em></p><p>ok, sounds good
next topic:

and I think the CoC is on a good path</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:38 PM</em></p><p>The only conference-related note is that we&rsquo;re
looking at a potential opportunity to host an online-only
conference sometime in September/October,
but we don&rsquo;t have details or info on the $$ piece yet</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:39 PM</em></p><p>thanks @mmerrell</p><p><em>8:40</em></p><p>should we move to the next topic?</p><p><em>David Burns 8:40 PM</em></p><p>regarding online confs I would like people to speak to their
respective marketing companies and see if it&rsquo;s being over done</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:40 PM</em></p><p>that&rsquo;s my #1 concern</p><p><em>David Burns 8:40 PM</em></p><p>there are so many atm&mldr;</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:40 PM</em></p><p>how&rsquo;s Breakpoint looking, btw?</p><p><em>David Burns 8:41 PM</em></p><p>It&rsquo;s good so far but I know marketing

but that may change</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:42 PM</em></p><p>@simonstewart was talking about potentially having a webinar
series instead of a 6-hour block of content, and I&rsquo;m kind
of interested in anything that will keep the zoom fatigue to a minimum</p><p>unfortunately, online conferences are not my thing,
as an organizer or a participant&mldr; this might make
me an ideal candidate to create an event that won&rsquo;t over-do it</p><p><em>David Burns 8:42 PM</em></p><p>heheh</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:43 PM</em></p><p>ok, seems we can move to the next topic</p><p>Selenium Branding guide</p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 8:44 PM</em></p><p>We’ve always get many requests on usage of Selenium Logo for
multiple purposes, PLC usually respond to those
requests with the help of SFC folks.</p><p>And there is also an issue to track : <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/seleniumhq.github.io/issues/81>https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/seleniumhq.github.io/issues/81</a>
This has been long pending and finally we&rsquo;ve started with it&mldr;</p><p><em>8:45</em></p><p>Selenium Branding guide is in-progress. Its on a private Google doc shared with the PLC and TLC members.
The legal rep from the SFC team has reviewed and shared feedback and recommendations.
And right now its with our Selenium team (PLC, TLC(may not be all of TLC) to look at it and see if we need more clarifications.</p><p><em>8:46</em></p><p>@simonstewart @diemol @AutomatedTester and others When you get a moment, pls take a look and share your feedback</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:47 PM</em></p><p>I think it makes sense to have something like that, it is easy
to see the Selenium logo / name misused in many places</p><p>that&rsquo;s a good initiative @manoj9788!</p><p><em>David Burns 8:47 PM</em></p><p>What does this mean when people use our brand incorrectly.
Like there is a linkedin group that charges for people making specific posts there.</p><p><em>8:48</em></p><p>(from what I am told)
do we have recourse to challenge them?</p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 8:49 PM</em></p><p>That reminds of another questions,<code>What are social media accounts that are handled by SeleniumHQ team?</code></p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:49 PM</em></p><p>using it to promote &ldquo;Selenium Certification&rdquo; is the example I see most often
I believe we&rsquo;ve done it before (before I joined the PLC)
&ldquo;done it&rdquo; == &ldquo;challenged them&rdquo;</p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 8:50 PM</em></p><p>AFAIK,
Twitter: SeleniumHQ, SeleniumConference are handled by SeleniumHQ team.
LinkedIn: Is there one?
Facebook: I think there is one, but don&rsquo;t think anyone from SeleniumHQ team is handling that.</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:51 PM</em></p><p>we should hire a tween to manage our insta
(and TikTok)
only half-kidding</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:51 PM</em></p><p>there is this <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/selenium/about/>https://www.linkedin.com/company/selenium/about/</a>
and this <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/selenium/about/>https://www.linkedin.com/company/selenium/about/</a></p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:51 PM</em></p><p>especially considering how many tweens
use Selenium to do fortnite/roblox stuff</p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 8:51 PM</em></p><p>TikTok is officially banned in India :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:51 PM</em></p><p>lol</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:52 PM</em></p><p>sorry, the 2nd link was meant to be this one
<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/groups/961927/>https://www.linkedin.com/groups/961927/</a> (edited)</p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 8:52 PM</em></p><p>ok, no politics here.
No idea, who owns that.</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:54 PM</em></p><p>I feel this topic overlaps with the last one in the agenda:
Selenium marketing strategy (e.g: Webpack)</p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 8:55 PM</em></p><p>Diego you could share some insights on the example you gave on Webpack</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:56 PM</em></p><p>yeah, I was trying to find some info while Googling</p><p><em>8:57</em></p><p>the idea I heard, is that webpack was not having a good moment in terms of users and reputation
and revamping their image (docs, social media, and of course improving the project code) helped them enormously
so this point is just to have a conversation starter and see if you think something similar makes sense for Selenium</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:58 PM</em></p><p>It’s useful. I think we should also take a look at the
things that people like about Cypress and make it
clear how to surface the same thing in Selenium
:+1::skin-tone-4:</p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 8:59 PM</em></p><p>Agreed! I think it makes sense @diemol</p><p><em>David Burns 8:59 PM</em></p><p>I would love for us to do something here.
@simonstewart and I have previously discussed this as &ldquo;fit and finish&rdquo;</p><p><em>9:00</em></p><p>these are the things that people like about puppeteer/cypress and we&rsquo;ve not done a good job of explaining similar things</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:01 PM</em></p><p>Indeed.
TBH, I thought we’d be done with Se4 at this point
And well into the fit-and-finish bit that could be Se5
But I agree with @diemol that part of that is a nice site with excellent docs</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:02 PM</em></p><p>nice, so it seems there is a general feeling that we should be doing something like that
I can try to do something about it and give an update for the next meeting</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 9:02 PM</em></p><p>Just one piece isn’t good enough to solve the problems
That’d be fantastic, @diemol</p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 9:02 PM</em></p><p>Happy to pair on that @diemol</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:02 PM</em></p><p>sounds good!</p><p><em>9:03</em></p><p>well, that was the last topic in the agenda, and we are 3 minutes past the end of the meeting
thank you everyone!</p><p><em>David Burns 9:03 PM</em></p><p>yay</p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 9:03 PM</em></p><p>And we&rsquo;ve moved from Master to Trunk
Thanks @AutomatedTester</p><p><em>David Burns 9:03 PM</em></p><p>yes, and it was an important move</p><p><em>Manoj Kumar Kumar 9:04 PM</em></p><p>Thanks @diemol @simonstewart @AutomatedTester and everyone!</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-1d4d31bcbc155da86e7bffb30cec301f>Moving to Trunk</h1><div class=lead>Why we are getting rid of <code>master</code> branch in favour of <code>trunk</code></div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>David Burns (<a href=https://twitter.com/AutomatedTester>@AutomatedTester</a>)</b> |
<time datetime=2020-07-01 class=text-body-secondary>Wednesday, July 01, 2020</time></div><p>Since the project started we have been following <a href=https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/>trunk based development</a>. This was a very natural fit when we were using SVN over a decade ago on Google Code.</p><p>As Google Code shut down we moved to GitHub and the git model of doing things. We moved there mostly due to the gravity that GitHub had created in Open Source projects.</p><p>This meant that we followed the standard use of <code>master</code> as our trunk to work off. Now that GitHub, and services that use GitHub, have improved support for non-master branches as default we are moving our default branch to <code>trunk</code>. It describes how we, as a project, work and is a more inclusive term.</p><p>If you have pull requests based on <code>master</code> we will see about moving that over to the <code>trunk</code> branch ourselves. If we can&rsquo;t, we may ask you to help with the rebasing.</p><p>We, as a project, want to make our community inclusive and this is just one step in making sure we are. Other steps we taking are improving our Code of Conduct and Community Guidelines.</p><p>Join us on Slack or IRC if you wish to discuss this further.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-20d1ed250e915bd21fa198129d27819d>How Selenium Works: Episode 1 - Transportation</h1><div class=lead>A series describing how Selenium works under the hood</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>David Burns (<a href=https://twitter.com/AutomatedTester>@AutomatedTester</a>)</b> |
<time datetime=2020-06-10 class=text-body-secondary>Wednesday, June 10, 2020</time></div><p>After an interaction on the last weekend of January 2020, on a Selenium Issue where someone said “why can’t you just…” after I explained the issue I thought that I would start explaining commands in Selenium WebDriver and why we landed on the design that we have today.</p><p>I will repeat this on every page of the series but a lot, an annoying amount sometimes, of thinking goes into how every little bit of Selenium works.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Selenium, by chance and being good at what it does, is used by millions of people around the world as well. It&rsquo;s how companies from Microsoft and Google to the small startup make sure that their site works in every browser.</p><h2 id=how-does-selenium-talk-to-the-browser>How Does Selenium talk to the browser?</h2><p>Selenium, over the years, decided that we were going to use HTTP to speak to the browser. We built a REST-ish API that every client binding could use and hopefully get the same results.</p><h3 id=http-and-rest-ish-really>HTTP and REST-ish? Really?</h3><p>Yea&mldr;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with the HTTP part. When we started we had to have a unique way to speak for each browser based on the best way to speak to them. So for Internet Explorer we wrote COM code. It was fine, it worked but gave us nightmares. For Firefox we wrote a monstrocity that read line by line and, thankfully, due to Mozilla&rsquo;s &ldquo;make the browser yours&rdquo; attitude we could do a lot. Opera allowed us to go in via the DevTools protocol.</p><p>Now, it meant that, especially in the early days of WebDriver, we would need to maintain N: M bindings where N is the language bindings and M is the browsers we support. This is not a road to a good product. We decided that we need something that every language would understand. We also needed something that would be pretty robust. HTTP was chosen and we set about building the <code>JSONWireProtocol</code>.</p><p>The <code>JSONWireProtocol</code> is where we built a REST-ish interface that would speak JSON. I say REST-ish because it didn&rsquo;t follow all the principles of REST but enough to make it powerful for our needs.</p><h3 id=how-does-it-relate-to-things-now>How does it relate to things now?</h3><p>The Web, the internet, and the world has moved on. Why hasn&rsquo;t Selenium?</p><p>This is a good question and the thing is we are trying to move things on. Unfortunately the web has a state where it is broken unless it is working. HTTP is pretty robust as a protocol. It can also allow people to build up clusters for testing without having to worry too much about how the multiplexing would work. This is the reason why Selenium Grid was created and is still a pretty good choice when it comes to farming out your testing to multiple devices and multiple machines.</p><h3 id=but-some-automation-framework-that-uses-chrome-debug-protocol-is-more-like-the-web-be-like-them>But <strong>Some automation Framework that uses Chrome Debug Protocol</strong> is more like the web, be like them.</h3><p>So&mldr; There are tools that use Chrome&rsquo;s Debug Protocol to drive the browser and some of the things they do better than Selenium are down to their choice of how they speak to the speak to the browser. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s a Chrome proprietary protocol and Google is not interested in working with other browsers on making it not.</p><p>Also, ignoring the interesting design choices from the the Google team, there is the problem that we have to have a permenantly open connection. In this case it uses WebSockets but if you remember my comment earlier about the internet is down until it&rsquo;s up. WebSockets would be constantly re-establishing the connection. There is also the problem of how much traffic would be going up and down that pipe.</p><p>This is fine for puppeteer where you are only speaking to something on your local machine but if you are combining a CI service, like Circle CI or TravisCI and something like AWS Device Farm, Sauce Labs, or BrowserStack you suddenly have a lot of internet inbetween you and your runner and that data needs to get somewhere.</p><p>The W3C Browser Testing and Tools Working group, which is made up of browser vendors and Selenium folk, are trying to design what this will look like to make sure that we can make it cross browser from the start without having to do weird hacky patches to browsers and ship those browsers ourselves.</p><h2 id=want-to-read-more>Want to read more?</h2><ul><li><a href=https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#processing-model>WebDriver Specification details about transport</a></li></ul><p>This was originally posted to <a href=https://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/>https://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/</a></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-5ea95a2871af986472bd000d19809b7e>Public Project Meeting - June 04, 2020</h1><div class=lead>Continuing the series of bi-weekly public project meetings&mldr;</div><div class="td-byline mb-4">By <b>Sri Harsha (<a href=https://twitter.com/sri_harsha509>@sri_harsha509</a>)</b> |

(if its happened in the last two weeks, anything to report)</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:36 PM</em></p><p>it happened Tuesday, and I believe we primarily discussed the conference</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:38 PM</em></p><p>ah perfect, there is an item in the agenda for &ldquo;SeConf India SeConf Chicago&rdquo;</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:38 PM</em></p><p>@manoj9788 will know the most about that</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:40 PM</em></p><p>yep</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:40 PM</em></p><p>is there something else to comment from SFC or conferences? or should we move to the next item?</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:40 PM</em></p><p>I can speak for Chicago</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think we talked about anything else&mldr; the SFC wasn&rsquo;t present on the call</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:41 PM</em></p><p>would you like to say something about the Chicago conference?'</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:41 PM</em></p><p>yeah&ndash;we&rsquo;re negotiating with the hotel to take our contract and move it to 2021, around the same time of year</p><p><em>8:42</em></p><p>we&rsquo;re waiting to hear back from them with a selection of dates in the Sep-Oct-Nov range</p><p>hoping not to have it the week before Thanksgiving, but also hoping to keep the room rates low</p><p><em>8:43</em></p><p>as to this year, we&rsquo;re talking about holding a very sane, relatively small virtual conference, or a series of webinars spread over a couple months</p><p>we&rsquo;re also discussing having another group help us out with planning and execution, someone with experience at promoting and running virtual conferences</p><p><em>8:44</em></p><p>the first discussion will happen today, and if we decide to explore further, I will probably feel more comfortable talking about who we&rsquo;re considering</p><p>there is a lot to consider for a virtual conference, and we want to make sure we are thoughtful and careful</p><p><em>Rajendra Kadam 8:44 PM</em></p><p>replied to a thread:
And a high five to @rajendra for his work on the JDBC stuff
Thanks @simonstewart.
. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been complete without your help.
1</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:44 PM</em></p><p>all that is already a lot of info, thanks for sharing!</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:45 PM</em></p><p>for SeConf India, I don&rsquo;t know if @manoj9788 is on and would like to share. If not, I can at least say a little about what they&rsquo;re considering, I just don&rsquo;t want it to be incomplete</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:46 PM</em></p><p>up to you I would say</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:48 PM</em></p><p>it appears that there&rsquo;s no way they&rsquo;re going to be able to put on a conference in September in Bangalore. The borders and COVID caseload aren&rsquo;t adequately under control, and much like the US conference, there are too many variables that would need to be under control right now for Naresh to feel confident about having an in-person conference a scant 3 months from now
1</p><p>(by &ldquo;borders&rdquo; I mean &ldquo;international travel & quarantine procedures&rdquo;)</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:48 PM</em></p><p>that makes a lot of sense</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:50 PM</em></p><p>so we are discussing whether or not we can essentially combine the notion of a virtual conference. That troubles me because I know that all parties involved want to see revenue, but the Selenium project doesn&rsquo;t want to charge for admission. I&rsquo;m concerned there would be too many hands in the pot for any one of them to receive enough $$ to make it worth their while</p><p>but that&rsquo;s my own concern&ndash;not meant to represent the opinion of the planning committee. We&rsquo;re looking for data, not opinions&ndash;so we&rsquo;re reaching out to people who have been through this in recent weeks to find out what&rsquo;s possible</p><p>8:51
we hope to report in a couple weeks on any progress, both with planning the virtual conference, and with whether or not we can expect to fund our coffers in the near future</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:51 PM</em></p><p>ok, then we can follow up in the next meeting, thanks!
1</p><p>8:52
next topic: Did anyone pick up the ball to talk to Miki about the go bindings?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:52 PM</em></p><p>Not me</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:52 PM</em></p><p>I think no one did but we should keep the topic around, and try to get to it when we have Se 4 released or close to be released</p><p>8:53
adding one more binding now would be too distracting
which does not mean that we cannot reach out to him</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:54 PM</em></p><p>Agreed</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:55 PM</em></p><p>ok, let&rsquo;s move to the next one since we only have a few minutes left</p><p>Selenium Conf website in GitHub org?</p><p>I see the site was revamped, so great job @andrewmkrug</p><p>8:56
but I am not sure if @andrewmkrug is having problems to push the code to the org
I can reach out to him</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:56 PM</em></p><p>Thank you
1</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:56 PM</em></p><p>next topic: IDE to main repo?</p><p><em>8:57</em></p><p>I guess we should focus more on the bindings and the Grid for now?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:58 PM</em></p><p>I think @AutomatedTester has already done a chunk of the heavy lifting</p><p><em>9:00</em></p><p>Got to go. Meeting time</p><p><em>Diego Molina 9:00 PM</em></p><p>last topic was CoC, but we can take it next time</p><p>well, we covered everything (almost), thank you everyone!
1</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 9:01 PM</em></p><p>thank YOU, @diemol

open issues: 391
open pull request: 68
(which is the lowest i think ive seen either of those numbers before)</p><p><em>8:03</em></p><p>agenda wise, this is going to be more loosey-goosey than normal as i’m swamped with day job so ignoring things. we’ll see is that is a good thing or not.</p><p><em>8:03</em></p><p>any overall announcements? new people on committees, have the commit bit, etc?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:04 PM</em></p><p>I’ve landed the update to OpenTracing, which unblocks me</p><p><em>8:04</em></p><p>Next step is to wire the tracing into the Docker support
And then pick up the websocket forwarding</p><p><em>8:05</em></p><p>(Which, to be fair, is “mostly done”)</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:05 PM</em></p><p>heh. the last 20% takes the other 80% of the time :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:05 PM</em></p><p>The Pareto Principle in action</p><p><em>8:06</em></p><p>I’d be happy pushing a6 before the next meeting</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:06 PM</em></p><p>what do we think is missing from a6 now?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:06 PM</em></p><p>It’s been a while since we did a release, and there’s progress in there</p><p><em>8:07</em></p><p>I’d dearly love the websocket forwarding, but I can live without it
@diemol landed the first work with Fail Safe for some more robustness in the Grid</p><p><em>8:08</em></p><p>I think @barancev is also making some progress switching the underlying HTTP engine again</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:08 PM</em></p><p>looks like there was a bunch of plumbing / dependencies updated in the last week especially with .net and python</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:08 PM</em></p><p>@jimevans and @AutomatedTester know more than I do</p><p><em>Jim Evans 8:10 PM</em></p><p>yes, the .NET bindings build using bazel should now work cross-platform. you should be able to run .NET tests using bazel test (with caveats, which i’ve yet to fully document). it kinda works within VS code, but one can for certain develop using Visual Studio 2019 on Windows, and Visual Studio for Mac on MacOS.</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:11 PM</em>
(still breaks my head to write .net code on mac)</p><p><em>8:11</em></p><p>what more was needed for the http engine stuff? i thought there was a flag in there already?</p><p><em>8:12</em></p><p>or did we change it again, again</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:13 PM</em></p><p>The underlying library didn’t support http/2 or unix domain sockets, despite it being possible</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:14 PM</em></p><p>so do we want/need to wait for that work to be done-ish before doing a6? so far that sounds like the only thing that will be confusing to release partially implemented</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:14 PM</em></p><p>Nah.</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:15 PM</em></p><p>scans commits in another window</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:15 PM</em></p><p>As long as it’s in before we start on the betas, we’ll be fine</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:15 PM</em></p><p>a question i know we dont have an answer for, but do we have a gut feel for how many more a’s there are before we start the b’s?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:16 PM</em></p><p>The major outstanding features are:
websocket forwarding
graph-ql support</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:16 PM</em></p><p>thats not that horrid of a list. its been much worse</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:17 PM</em></p><p>We’ve been chipping away at it</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:18 PM</em></p><p>so if a6 is within the next 2 weeks, do we have a trigger condition for releasing it?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:18 PM</em></p><p>No trigger condition</p><p><em>8:18</em></p><p>Other than “someone updates the changelog”, I guess</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:19 PM</em></p><p>do we want to say ‘a6 is next tuesday’ so that all the maintainers are ready to build and tag everything? (feel like we can’t magically do it all from ci but could be making that up)</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:20 PM</em></p><p>The graphql piece is to support the ui, so strictly speaking we don’t really need it, but it keeps things flexible</p><p><em>8:20</em></p><p>@AutomatedTester, @p0deje, @jimevans, @titusfortner, @harsha509 Cool with shipping an alpha next week?</p><p><em>Jim Evans 8:21 PM</em></p><p>+1 from me.</p><p><em>Sri Harsha 8:21 PM</em></p><p>Yes</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:22 PM</em></p><p>how are we handling the numbers in JS, JS is already in a7, right?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:22 PM</em></p><p>“alpha-n+1”</p><p><em>Sri Harsha 8:22 PM</em></p><p>Yes @diemol . Do you have any suggestions @corevo . He should be releasing the next alpha as i know.</p><p><em>Alex Rodionov 8:23 PM</em></p><p>+1 from me</p><p><em>Tomer Steinfeld 8:25 PM</em></p><p>JS has been in alpha for a long time because of historical reasons</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:25 PM</em></p><p>ok. so thats covers the bulk of the pressing tech stuff. other stuff that could be discussed;
when is the next sfc call? (if its happened in the last two weeks, anything to report)
did anyone pick up the ball to talk to miki about the go bindings?
seconf india
seconf us
state of the se-ide into the main repo</p><p><em>Tomer Steinfeld 8:25 PM</em></p><p>I think we can land stable 4.0 together, but I don&rsquo;t see a reason we should release 4 alphas together</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:26 PM</em></p><p>(or we can keep talking about js too. but that list is just my remaining things)</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:26 PM</em></p><p>the PLC call happened on Tuesday, it was just me and Jim. We mostly talked about conferences, and we were going to follow up with Simon about the status of the Code of Conduct</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:27 PM</em></p><p>Uhh… I thought @AutomatedTester was running with the CoC stuff.</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:27 PM</em></p><p>at this point India is still slated to happen in September, same venue. I don&rsquo;t know the latest about speakers or progress or anything like that</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:27 PM</em></p><p>It’s entirely possible I am mistaken</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:27 PM</em></p><p>i thought david was on that too</p><p><em>Tomer Steinfeld 8:27 PM</em></p><p>Is there an update from the SFC about the MS store?</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:28 PM</em></p><p>ok, I thought David was on the MS Store issue, and not the CoC, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time I was mistaken</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:28 PM</em></p><p>why don&rsquo;t we take the CoC draft we have, add it to the new site, and iterate on it?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:28 PM</em></p><p>We were going to get a review and some guidance from Sage Sharp</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:29 PM</em></p><p>for Chicago, we&rsquo;ve got a verbal understanding that the venue will allow us to reschedule the conference for sometime next year with no fees. We&rsquo;ve already given them a somewhat hefty deposit, and while we could likely fight to get that back, we&rsquo;d rather just have it next April or October&ndash;we&rsquo;re going to make that decision in late May/early June</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:30 PM</em></p><p>for the SeleniumConf website, @andrewmkrug has joined the Selenium GitHub org, and he is helping us to push the site code to a private repo</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:30 PM</em></p><p>for the Fall, we&rsquo;re considering an online-only conference, and we&rsquo;re waiting for a few pieces of data to come in over the next couple weeks, around TestBash and SauceCon, to gauge how they went, ideas for optimization, pros/cons, do&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s, etc</p><p><em>Andrew Krug 8:30 PM</em></p><p>was added to #selenium-tlc by Diego Molina.</p><p><em>Marcus Merrell 8:32 PM</em></p><p>I spoke to Deb (from SFC) quite a bit on Friday about tips and pointers for an online-only conference, and I&rsquo;ve started to develop some opinions for how it should be done. I haven&rsquo;t yet, however, come up with a firm position on the pricing model for sponsors or attendees&ndash;I definitely want to offer all the track sessions/keynotes for free, and offer a paid tier for &ldquo;something&rdquo; else, like if people want T-shirts or something else, but it would likely be a model where they pay what they want (to support the project), and the swag they get depends on the tier they buy into</p><p><em>8:33</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m waiting to hear more from Richard Bradshaw before beginning that discussion, probably during our bi-weekly Conference conference call, on May 28th</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:35 PM</em></p><p>so. CoC — when can we get the review and guidance? if its more than ‘not in may’ we should likely throw it up and start the iteration process</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:36 PM</em></p><p>It depends on Sage’s availability, and that of the people working on the CoC</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:37 PM</em></p><p>(which, sounds like we’re not quite sure of who those are from our end)</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:37 PM</em></p><p>Last I checked, @mmerrell, @AutomatedTester, @diemol, @jimevans and I were all interested in being involved</p><p><em>8:38</em></p><p>From memory.</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:38 PM</em></p><p>so the nebulous items seem to be;
determine who is actually on the coc stuff</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:38 PM</em></p><p>Agreed</p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:38 PM</em></p><p>doh! no editing. and,
determine who is actually doing the ms store stuff</p><p><em>8:40</em></p><p>which means, for the next meeting;</p><ul><li>release a6 (a7 of js)</li><li>report who is point and who is assisting with the CoC</li><li>report who is leading the ms store stuff</li></ul><p><em>8:41</em></p><p>anyone else have anything they want / need to discuss in public?</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:41 PM</em></p><p>I’m good</p><p><em>8:41</em></p><p>Though perhaps we should figure out who owns what on that list
I hold the build bacon this time</p><p><em>Diego Molina 8:42 PM</em></p><p>maybe we can record how a release is done? and from that I can write docs</p><p><em>Simon Stewart 8:43 PM</em></p><p>I’ll walk you through the process
We did have it written up here: <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Releasing-Selenium>https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Releasing-Selenium</a></p><p><em>adamgoucher 8:43 PM</em></p><p>from the april 23 meeting, looks like @AutomatedTester is the store person

@adamgoucher there needs to be a calendar invite for these things</p><p>adamgoucher 4:32 PM
well, originally the idea was that people could manage their own calendars but if you send me which email you want it attached to i can add you to the one ive been putting people on who wanted an invite</p><p>4:35 anyhow; here’s the rough approximation of an agenda. we’ll see how it goes;</p><ul><li>anything governance-y that needs to be discussed in public (not limited to, but including public announcement of people getting the commit bit, etc.)</li><li>status of prs</li><li>status of issues</li><li>status of se project related events (india, chicago are the big ones)</li><li>next release status and/or timeline</li><li>go around the metaphorical table on how people are doing against things they signed up for</li><li>anything that needs to get sussed out in public (from reading the channel, the main thing that came up is the js discussion)</li><li>open the floor for other discussions either instigated by ’project people</li></ul><p>4:38
anything governance-y that needs to be discussed in public (not limited to, but including public announcement of people getting the commit bit, etc.)</p><p>Diego Molina 4:38 PM
if there is time, let&rsquo;s add the recent topic of adding go bindings</p><p>adamgoucher 4:38 PM
has there been an sfc call recently? (i cant remember when they are)</p><p>Diego Molina 4:40 PM
governance related, I&rsquo;d say:
we need to define where we put these meetings minutes, how we announce them widely (do we need?), and that we still need a code of conduct</p><p>adamgoucher 4:41 PM
ok. @diemol pester my monday morning if i haven&rsquo;t figured out how to get them onto the blog by then</p><p>Diego Molina 4:41 PM
So, meetings minutes&mldr; we can put them in the same format as a blog entry, and we can tag/label them so they are publicly accessible
I can do that, I would just need the contents of the previous meetings, and also add small instructions on how to add new ones</p><p>adamgoucher 4:43 PM
i think we just start with this one. i didnt take the most excellent notes the last couple and they might have expired out the channel (havent scrolled up to check)</p><p>Diego Molina 4:43 PM
ok, so I will start doing that with this onee</p><p>adamgoucher 4:44 PM
who is the point person for the code of conduct</p><p>Diego Molina 4:44 PM
@AutomatedTester said something about being working on it?
4:44
but we currently have a draft, why don&rsquo;t we use that draft and iterate on it?</p><p>adamgoucher 4:45 PM
makes sense. as we did with the other doc</p><p>4:46
ok. next thing on the list is status of prs. which @AutomatedTester has been culling like a mad man over the last week and we’re down the 62</p><p>4:47
followed closely by status of issues and there is now 402 which i think he is also attacking (but i dont have a number from 2 weeks ago)</p><p>Diego Molina 4:48 PM
perhaps we should set up a project health status dashboard
I saw a couple of OSS projects that could do that</p><p>adamgoucher 4:49 PM
could be interesting. of course we could also then get into wild semantic discussions around ‘what’ healthy is. :smile:</p><p>4:50
next; status of se project related events (india, chicago are the big ones)</p><p>4:51
i saw that seconf india has been moved to september. how is chicago looking?</p><p>Diego Molina 4:51 PM
I think no one is around who could reply that question</p><p>David Burns 4:52 PM
I also think it&rsquo;s too early to comment. Chicago is in lockdown at the moment for the foreseeable</p><p>4:52
we also need to be see how many venues are still around when we come out of our homes</p><p>Isaul Vargas 4:53 PM
As for big cities in the US, only by End of May can we know if restrictions will be lifted due to testing and lowering the curve.</p><p>adamgoucher 4:53 PM
(it has more of a recurring agenda item more than me seeing someone who can answer)</p><p>4:54
and restrictions will be lifted in june and clamped back down in july. as is the way in a pandemic. (and really, will be until we get a vaccine)</p><p>4:55
next item; next release status and/or timeline. @simonstewart?</p><p>Simon Stewart 4:55 PM
India has been moved to later in the year</p><p>4:56
We’re running the 4.0 release in the open: <a href=https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/projects/2>https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/projects/2</a></p><p>4:56
The config stuff won’t be too horrible. I’m quite liking the fact that TOML opens up some options</p><p>adamgoucher 4:56 PM
yup. so is your plan still ‘push the button on stage to do the release and retire for your daily beverage’ or are we aiming for a same-ish part of the calender</p><p>Simon Stewart 4:56 PM
When we ship, I stand down</p><p>4:57
I’d still like to get the betas out soon</p><p>4:57
But there are some big pieces missing before we can get to that point</p><p>4:58
The big one being the CDP stuff across Grid, which I’ve many of the moving parts for in various branches on my machine</p><p>Diego Molina 4:58 PM
when I look at the things on the &ldquo;to do&rdquo; column, maybe 80% is Grid, right?</p><p>5:00
if so, it is something that calms me down because at least (from my side), I am having slowly more time to work on the code</p><p>5:00
but there are a couple of things on that list which concern me: IDE to the monorepo (and build it with bazel) + implement CDP and relative locators in JS</p><p>David Burns 5:01 PM
I am doing the IDE to mono repo now</p><p>5:01
relative locators in JS should be easy, I can do it or talk @harsha509 through it</p><p>Diego Molina 5:02 PM
but in the IDE, what is our approach in terms of browser extension vs. electron</p><p>5:02
right now we could only do the browser extension, right?</p><p>David Burns 5:02 PM
that is separate from the mono repo work</p><p>5:03
these are questions for @tourdedave and @corevo</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:03 PM
Right now, there’s just the browser extension, but @tourdedave and @corevo did start work on the electron port</p><p>5:03
I’m not sure what kind of progress they’re making, if any</p><p>Diego Molina 5:04 PM
ok, so it seems we will only focus on the browser extension for now</p><p>adamgoucher 5:07 PM
ok, so to summarize;
all the known to-dos are in the github project
india has been shifted, but dont want to just move the target to september
aiming for betas to start soon, grid cdp is really the last big hurdle until those can start</p><p>Diego Molina 5:08 PM
and the JS stuff, right?</p><p>5:08
(CDP + relative locators)</p><p>adamgoucher 5:09 PM
i think we can skip the next thing which is ‘how are people progressing on the stuff they signed up for’ with a ‘see the github project’</p><p>5:11
because the next thing on the list i prepared was <code>- anything that needs to get sussed out in public</code> which, for today, means ‘what to do about javascript’. not sure that anything got resolved the other day but i think the core of it is ‘webdriver.js is the official binding but not under the auspices of the project’ or something?</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:11 PM
To reiterate feedback from other people, and my own reflections:</p><p>5:12
There is a general feeling that the selenium project should own the core of its own bindings
We’ve gone from having basically no-one interested in JS to having Sri on board (@harsha509)
We’ve not nailed down the overall strategy yet</p><p>5:14
Which kind of suggests not using webdriver.io’s webdriver module, but continuing to work with our own stuff</p><p>5:14
Unless that module moves under the aegis of the project</p><p>Diego Molina 5:15 PM
oh, actually I was talking to @christian-bromann about it, and he manifested again his interest to help move the JS bindings to use the webdriver package, and leave things ready for someone who wants to maintain the bindings</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:15 PM
And if the code for the webdriver package was in our repo, I think that’s probably what we’d do</p><p>Diego Molina 5:16 PM
I am not a 100% sure that he is ok with moving the code from that package to our repo
but in the worst case, would a copy/fork of the code work?</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:17 PM
That seems like a bad idea</p><p>Christian Bromann 5:17 PM
What is the problem of not having the webdriver binding in the Selenium repo?</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:18 PM
The feedback I’ve had from several people has been that they’re deeply uncomfortable with it, and won’t approve of it</p><p>5:18
It’s not just a technical thing</p><p>5:18
There are the social aspects to consider too</p><p>Christian Bromann 5:19 PM
I understand.</p><p>Diego Molina 5:20 PM
well, the idea of the committees is to reach consensus in these cases, and it looks like we would never reach it for this situation</p><p>Christian Bromann 5:20 PM
Well the idea of generating raw bindings based of some json files is pretty easy to reimplement and I am happy to support how it can be done.</p><p>5:22
copying over the code form WebdriverIO to Selenium is rather difficult as it depends on some other wdio utilities (logging and utility functions)</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:22 PM
I do wonder how far adrift the JS bindings are</p><p>5:23
The obvious missing 4.0 features are relative locators and the CDP integration</p><p>5:23
The CDP integration isn’t nailed down properly anywhere. We’ve got access to the raw protocol, but we’ve yet to build the abstractions people would actually write against</p><p>Christian Bromann 5:23 PM
Given the situation I am would be also happy to invite the Selenium JS contributor to the WebdriverIO org to ensure code access and ability to merge/review code changes.</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:24 PM
Thank you</p><p>Diego Molina 5:25 PM
well, then it seems JS bindings stay as they are
hopefully we all find a way to make them fit for the 4.0 release</p><p>5:25
should we talk about the go bindings?</p><p>adamgoucher 5:26 PM
thats the only other thing on my list</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:26 PM
We can talk about Go bindings</p><p>5:27
Miki offered to donate <a href=https://github.com/tebeka/selenium>https://github.com/tebeka/selenium</a> to the project a while ago</p><p>5:27
I got busy and had health issues, so dropped things on the floor</p><p>5:27
Should we pick that back up again?</p><p>adamgoucher 5:28 PM
is he also intending to maintain it (dunno the status of them) or is it a ‘i did a thing and dont need it anymore so someone can pick it up if they want’</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:28 PM
I dunno</p><p>5:28
That would be part of the conversation</p><p>David Burns 5:29 PM
if it&rsquo;s the latter then I am not sure we would want them. It&rsquo;s amazingly nice but the maintenance burden, potentially, doesnt feel worth it</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:30 PM
Indeed</p><p>5:30
But it would be nice to have some “official” Go bindings.</p><p>adamgoucher 5:30 PM
i know nothing about go, but i feel like the bar for any binding to be included in the main project;
is it maintained?
is it idomatically correct for the language?
is there not a competing, more obvious one to incorporate?</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:30 PM
Turns out that people like them</p><p>5:30
s/them/the language/</p><p>Diego Molina 5:30 PM
seems it is worthy to give the conversation a go</p><p>5:30
who would like to drive that conversation with Miki?</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:31 PM
It’s pretty dormant right now, but is that due to being complete?
My understanding is “yes”
Nothing that I’m aware of</p><p>5:31
puts finger on nose</p><p>adamgoucher 5:31 PM
sounds like ‘you are a go’ for the conversation about go. as it were</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:31 PM
Not me</p><p>5:31
Yeah, I think it’s a conversation that’s well worth having</p><p>Diego Molina 5:32 PM
I can see from a quick look that the go bindings have vendor stuff in it, for example it has the ability to use Sauce Labs out of the box</p><p>5:33
even if I work for Sauce, we need to see all those things in case we want to merge them</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:34 PM
Aye</p><p>Diego Molina 5:36 PM
I know how the Grid works (in general), but I still have black spots in my head when talking about bindings
we need someone who knows how bindings should work and do a check on the go bindings</p><p>adamgoucher 5:37 PM
sounds like ‘we think having the go bindings in the main project is cool, but currently the people in the channel right now dont have enough interest (or knowledge) to drive the conversation’</p><p>5:38
likely also have to talk to sfc about rights transfer and such. though the existing licensing could cover it</p><p>Diego Molina 5:39 PM
maybe we bring the topic back in 2 weeks and see how people feel?</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:40 PM
SGTM</p><p>adamgoucher 5:41 PM
ok. i didnt have anything else? did anyone else?</p><p>Simon Stewart 5:42 PM
I’ve got other meetings to attend, so nowt from me</p><p>adamgoucher 5:43 PM
taking silence from the rest as a no. thanks everyone!</p><p>Diego Molina 5:43 PM
Thank you all!</p></div></main></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center p-5"><h2 class="selenium text-center">Development Partners</h2></div><div class="row justify-content-around pt-4 pb-5 px-5"><div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 mb-4 mb-lg-0 align-self-center px-5 py-3"><a href="https://www.browserstack.com/automate?utm_campaign=open-source-sponsor&amp;utm_campaigncode=701OW000009sQwVYAU&amp;utm_medium=partnered&amp;utm_source=seleniumorg" class=border-0><img class="w-100 shadow-1-strong rounded selenium-backer-logo" src=/images/sponsors/browserstack.png alt=BrowserStack></a></div><div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 mb-4 mb-lg-0 align-self-center px-5 py-3"><a href="https://saucelabs.com/resources/topic-hub/selenium?utm_source=selenium&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=selenium-sponsorship-fy25" class=border-0><img class="w-100 shadow-1-strong rounded selenium-backer-logo" src=/images/sponsors/saucelabs.png alt="Sauce Labs"></a></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center p-5"><h2 class="selenium text-center">Selenium Level Sponsors</h2></div><div class="row justify-content-around pt-4 pb-5 px-5"><div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 mb-4 mb-lg-0 align-self-center px-5 py-3"><a href="https://brightdata.com/?utm_source=brand&amp;utm_campaign=brnd-mkt_partners_selenium" class=border-0><img class="w-100 shadow-1-strong rounded selenium-backer-logo" src=/images/sponsors/bright-data.png alt="Bright Data"></a></div><div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 mb-4 mb-lg-0 align-self-center px-5 py-3"><a href=https://applitools.com/ class=border-0><img class="w-100 shadow-1-strong rounded selenium-backer-logo" src=/images/sponsors/applitools.png alt=Applitools></a></div><div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 mb-4 mb-lg-0 align-self-center px-5 py-3"><a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation?utm_source=selenium&amp;utm_medium=open-source-sponsor&amp;utm_campaign=nov_14&amp;utm_term=sk&amp;utm_content=web" class=border-0><img class="w-100 shadow-1-strong rounded selenium-backer-logo" src=/images/sponsors/lambda-test.png alt=LambdaTest></a></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center pt-2 pb-3 -bg-selenium-cyan"><div class="card text-center border-0 bg-transparent py-5"><div class="card-body text-white"><h2 class=card-title>Support the Selenium Project</h2><p class=card-text>Learn more or view the full list of sponsors.</p><div class=selenium-button-container><a href=/sponsors class="selenium-button selenium-white-cyan text-uppercase fw-bold">Learn more
