But for automation, it does so every single time.
To bypass this, use the argument below when specifying the browser options.

We started with the WebDriver Specification and over the last couple of years have been working with the Safari, Edge, Chrome, and Firefox teams on the WebDriver-BiDi specification.
Today, we are celebrating that Puppeteer has moved over to using WebDriver-BiDi, the new WebDriver Specification that allows WebDriver clients to have event driven APIs instead of the synchronous way Selenium has done it before.</description></item><item><title>Protecting unsecured Selenium Grids against SeleniumGreed</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2024/protecting-unsecured-selenium-grid/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2024/protecting-unsecured-selenium-grid/</guid><description>Over the last week there have been stories going around about crypto miners abusing unsecured Selenium Grids by injecting code in the session create to download and start up crypto miners. This came out thanks to the work from Wiz about an attack they have called SeleniumGreed.

Unfortunately, this can lead to muddying the waters of which features are available in any of the products out there especially when we compare apples to apples.
Selenium has always been a great tool for browser automation. Fortunately for the project, it has become the tool of choice for testing web applications for nearly 2 decades.</description></item><item><title>Removal of AbstractEventListener + EventFiringWebDriver + WebDriverEventListener</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/java-removal-of-deprecated-events-classes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/java-removal-of-deprecated-events-classes/</guid><description>Upgrading to WebDriverListener and EventFiringDecorator Decorating the webdriver
new EventFiringWebDriver(driver); // Old approach new EventFiringDecorator().decorate(driver); // New approach Implementing method wrappers One may find the need to have their own custom implementations be used for underlying decorated method calls. An example may be wanting to use your own findElement implementation to store metadata from web elements. One can go down a deep rabbit hole of decorators ( extending WebDriverDecorator and such ), so to keep things simple we will extend EventFiringDecorator since we want a single decorator to handle all our listener events.</description></item><item><title>InvalidSelectorException has changed</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/invalid-selector-exception-has-changed/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/invalid-selector-exception-has-changed/</guid><description>Before Selenium 4.8.2 in Java and C#, when an invalid locator was used to identify an element, the resulting behavior would be inconsistent in our bindings.
For example, let&amp;rsquo;s check the following code:

These releases included improvements, bug fixes, removal of deprecated functionality, improved error handling, updates of the underlying libraries, support for the latest Chrome DevTools versions to keep you in sync with new browser releases, but also new features.</description></item><item><title>BELLATRIX Test Automation Framework for C# and JAVA</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/bellatrix-test-automation-framework/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/bellatrix-test-automation-framework/</guid><description>Over the last decade, a large ecosystem of Open Source projects has sprouted up around Selenium. Selenium is often used for automating web applications for testing purposes, but it does not include a testing framework. Nowadays, Selenium Ecosystem initiatives try to give popularity to popular open-source test automation frameworks maintained by people outside of the core Selenium maintainers. One of these frameworks is BELLATRIX, invented by Anton Angelov.

This enables testers and developers to test their applications on pre-release versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge before their official releases, using container tools, such as Docker. This empowers teams to stay ahead of the curve and catch potential showstoppers in their CI environment before those issues have an impact on their users.</description></item><item><title>Scaling a Kubernetes Selenium Grid with KEDA</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/scaling-grid-with-keda/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/scaling-grid-with-keda/</guid><description>The Issue If you have any experience with Selenium Grid and Kubernetes you will probably run into an issue with scaling. Kubernetes (K8S) works wonders for scaling up and down applications based on their CPU and Memory usage, but it is not so straightforward when it comes down to applications like Selenium Grid.
The issue is described quite well in this blog post. But in short, the Horizontal Pod AutoScaler (HPA) that is built into Kubernetes checks (by default) for resource consumption to determine if a deployment needs to be scaled up or down.</description></item><item><title>Test Automation Summit Berlin</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/test-automation-summit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/test-automation-summit/</guid><description>Have you ever wanted to contribute to an open source testing project, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out where to start?

A lot of care has gone into the Java bindings, especially, to ensure very few breaking changes over the years.

It could be said that when working with Selenium, a critical aspect of writing tests is &amp;ldquo;locators, locators, locators!&amp;rdquo;. Having a robust locator strategy - in your app under test and in your test framework - is highly important for effective testing.
If you are a Pythonista like myself and using Selenium for your test automation, then there are some important changes coming to how locators are defined and used.</description></item><item><title>IE Mode in Edge supported by IEDriver</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/ie-edge-support/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/ie-edge-support/</guid><description>With the retirement of Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) later this year, the folks in Redmond have helped the Selenium project with getting IE Mode in Microsoft Edge working in IEDriver.
IE 11 is due to retire on 15 June 2022 for certain versions of Windows 10. After this date, the Selenium project recommends that you test your IE sites with IE Mode in Microsoft Edge.

The reasons for this are complex, but boil down to two main causes:
Browsers are complicated pieces of software that are constantly evolving. Mozilla has been working hard to make Firefox faster and more stable, while still retaining the flexibility and ease of extension that we’ve come to know and love. As part of that process, Firefox is switching extensions from the original “XPI” format, to a newer, more widely adopted “Web Extension” mechanism.</description></item><item><title>Hacking with IntelliJ</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2017/hacking-with-intellij/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2017/hacking-with-intellij/</guid><description>Jetbrains have a programme for Open Source projects which allows them to receive IntelliJ IDEA licenses.

I’ve been using Jetbrain’s IntelliJ to hack on the Selenium code since I started working on it slightly over ten years ago.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 3.0: Out Now!</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-0-out-now/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-0-out-now/</guid><description>We are very pleased to announce the release of Selenium 3.0. If you’ve been waiting for a stable release since 2.53.1, now’s your chance to update. And if you do, here is what you’ll find:
As we’ve said before, for users of the WebDriver APIs this is a drop-in replacement. You’ll find that modern browsers, such as Chrome and Edge will continue to work just as before, and we’ve taken the opportunity to fix some bugs and improve stability.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 3 is Coming</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-is-coming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-is-coming/</guid><description>Selenium 3 is coming! As I write this, we think that “beta 4” will be the last beta before the official 3.0 release. I’m here to tell you about what’s changed, and what impact this will have on your testing.
TL;DR: WebDriver users will just find bug fixes and a drop-in replacement for 2.x. Selenium Grid users will also find bug fixes and a simple update. The WebDriver APIs are now the only APIs actively supported by the Selenium project.</description></item><item><title>Announcing Selenium 3.0-beta1</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/announcing-selenium-3-0-beta1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/announcing-selenium-3-0-beta1/</guid><description>At SeleniumConf in 2013, we announced that a new major version of Selenium would be released “by Christmas”. Fortunately, we never said which Christmas, as it has taken us a while to make all the changes we wanted to make! We’re excited to announce the release of the first beta — Selenium 3.0.0-beta1.

UI Tests – putting it all together summarizes the series of posts using Watir and Cucumber, but the ideas could be converted to Se pretty easily.
I haven’t read it, but Essential Software Testdesign is now available for free [legitimately] as a pdf.

Want input in a non-english language but don’t want to convert your whole machine? InputKing might be able to help. And the fact it is in a browser means we can use it via Se.

There is now a DZone ‘refcard’ for Selenium 2.

This looks like it is Spanish which would normally mean it doesn’t get included but it Integração Selenium e Testlink explains how to integrate Se with TestLink.

I’m Raynatou, I come from Burkina and do my internship at SERLI. Like all interns in this company the topic of my internship focuses on advanced topics like the integration of WebDriver as backend for Selenium IDE. Selenium IDE is currently built upon Selenium Core for interacting with web pages. Selenium Core has several major limitations, including the inability to fire native events. To avoid these limitations and produce more robust tests, I am investigating Selenium IDE to using WebDriver in place of Selenium Core.</description></item><item><title>A Smattering of Selenium #22</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/a-smattering-of-selenium-22/</guid><description>Happy Simcoe Day.

But it could have been better — in ways that WebDriver was starting to be good at. Thus the brilliant idea was hatched to merge the two projects.
And then the confusion began. Let’s see if I can start to address some of it via a ficticious conversation that consolidates the Se-user list and #selenium irc channel.

Selenium Unit Test Reuse illustrates one way of iterating through environments and browsers in a script without using Se-Grid. I’ve done similar tricks to this to some success — the problem is usually reporting though, but you are all clever folks so I’m sure you could add it in.
