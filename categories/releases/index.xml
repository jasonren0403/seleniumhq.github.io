For this release, we made a relevant decision concerning the Selenium Manager versioning format. From now on, Selenium Manager will follow the same version as Selenium. Nevertheless, since Selenium Manager is still in beta, its major version is 0. Thus, Selenium 4.12.0 is shipped with Selenium Manager 0.4.12.
First, we made a substantial effort to stabilize the already available features on Selenium Manager.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 4.11.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/selenium-4-11-0-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/selenium-4-11-0-released/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re very happy to announce the release of Selenium 4.11.0 for Java, .NET, Ruby, Python, and Javascript as well as the Grid and Internet Explorer Driver.

Selenium Manager is a binary tool (implemented in Rust) that provides automated driver management for Selenium. Selenium Manager is still in beta, although it is becoming a relevant component of Selenium.
So far, the main feature of Selenium Manager is called automated driver management. I use the term management for this feature (and not just download) since this process is broader and implies different steps:</description></item><item><title>Building Selenium</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/building-selenium/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/building-selenium/</guid><description>One of the things that we knew from the very beginning of the Selenium project was that people like to code in more than one language. Some people love a bit of JS, others Ruby, and still others prefer C# or Java.
To complicate matters, there’s plenty of pieces we want to share between the language bindings you’ll be using. Examples include the “atoms” (re-usable pieces of javascript that perform common functions – such as “isDisplayed” or “getAttribute” – that we want to work the same way no matter which language you prefer to write tests in), things like our CDP support, which uses shared files that describe all the available functions we can call, and the new Selenium Manager, which is written in Rust, but we bundle with each of the language bindings.</description></item><item><title>Java 8 support in Selenium</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/java-8-support/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/java-8-support/</guid><description>“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” is a saying you may have heard, but sometimes it’s necessary to move on from our old favorites. That’s why we’re announcing that Selenium will stop supporting Java 8 on September 30, 2023. This applies for both the Java bindings and the Selenium Grid.
Selenium has long supported Java 8, but as technology evolves, so must we. One of the primary reasons for this change is that Java 8 reached the end of active support over a year ago.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 4.10.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/selenium-4-10-0-released/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/selenium-4-10-0-released/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re very happy to announce the release of Selenium 4.10.0 for Java, .NET, Ruby, Python, and Javascript as well as the Grid and Internet Explorer Driver.

It allows users to run automated scripts in headless mode, meaning that the browser window wouldn’t be visible.

If you’ve been waiting for a stable release since 2.53.1, now’s your chance to update. And if you do, here is what you’ll find:
As we’ve said before, for users of the WebDriver APIs this is a drop-in replacement. You’ll find that modern browsers, such as Chrome and Edge will continue to work just as before, and we’ve taken the opportunity to fix some bugs and improve stability.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 3 is Coming</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-is-coming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-is-coming/</guid><description>Selenium 3 is coming! As I write this, we think that “beta 4” will be the last beta before the official 3.0 release. I’m here to tell you about what’s changed, and what impact this will have on your testing.
TL;DR: WebDriver users will just find bug fixes and a drop-in replacement for 2.x. Selenium Grid users will also find bug fixes and a simple update. The WebDriver APIs are now the only APIs actively supported by the Selenium project.</description></item><item><title>Announcing Selenium 3.0-beta1</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/announcing-selenium-3-0-beta1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/announcing-selenium-3-0-beta1/</guid><description>At SeleniumConf in 2013, we announced that a new major version of Selenium would be released “by Christmas”. Fortunately, we never said which Christmas, as it has taken us a while to make all the changes we wanted to make! We’re excited to announce the release of the first beta — Selenium 3.0.0-beta1.
We’d love you to try it out on your projects, and provide us with feedback on where the rough edges are before we ship the 3.</description></item><item><title>Announcing Selenium 2.26: the “It’s Really Real” Release</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/announcing-selenium-2-26/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/announcing-selenium-2-26/</guid><description>It’s been a long time since we announced a new Selenium release on this blog, as we moved to a model of quicker releases, but we’ve been working on 2.26 for far longer than normal — it’s out! Download it now! — so I thought it best to let you know. We’re aiming to head back to faster releases, so hopefully you won’t see another blog post about the release for a while (though I’m sure they’ll appear in the “Smatterings of Selenium” posts)</description></item><item><title>Announcing Selenium 2.22</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/announcing-selenium-2-22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/announcing-selenium-2-22/</guid><description>It’s been a while since the last Selenium release, but I’m happy to announce that Selenium 2.22 is now available for download. This is a big release for us and features two major changes.
The first is that Selenium 2.22 is the first version that requires Java 6 in order to run. This has been the case for the Selenium Server for some time, but this is the first time the client code has required Java 6.</description></item><item><title>Announcing Selenium 2.19: the Prancing Unicorn release</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/announcing-selenium-2-19-the-prancing-unicorn-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2012/announcing-selenium-2-19-the-prancing-unicorn-release/</guid><description>You might be pleased to hear that Selenium 2.19 has been released (download it from here!). There’s one big user facing changing that we’d like to tell you about: the webdriver-backed selenium can now be used in supported languages.
By providing this capability, it’s possible to migrate from RC to the WebDriver APIs without rewriting all your tests in one fell swoop (which must be a Good Thing, right?)

As well as improving the stability of Grid under high loads, we’ve added an experimental (and temporary!) feature that allows the Firefox driver to use a different mechanism for determining when a page is loaded. This is designed to handle the case where the driver appears to hang, as it’s waiting for all incoming requests to complete before continuing. How to enable this mode is listed in the changelog.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 2.8 Released</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-8-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-8-released/</guid><description>In keeping with our (roughly) weekly releases, Selenium 2.8 was released today (and on Maven too), with a *huge* list of bug-fixes! As well as improved stability, if you’re using the Java API, this release adds the ability to upload files to a RemoteWebDriver server (see RemoteWebDriver.setFileDetector (http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/remote/RemoteWebDriver.html#setFileDetector(org.openqa.selenium.remote.FileDetector))).

Don’t worry: 2.4 and 2.5 were released on time and without muss or fuss. 2.6, on the other hand has been almost three weeks brewing.

The release notes for this version are pretty slim:
Better detection of clickable areas in Firefox. Merge of Google-contributed code into the underlying javascript libraries used by the drivers.

We’re proud to announce the release of Selenium 2.2. What’s new this time? For many users, this is simply a bug fix release as there are no new major features. One thing you might appreciate is better exceptions (http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/IllegalLocatorException.html) being thrown when xpath searches return something other than a web element when using the WebDriver APIs, and we’re continuing to tweak the emulation of user events.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 2.1 Released</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-1-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-1-released/</guid><description>Now that Selenium 2 has been released, one of the goals of the project is to provide regular updates to our users and the community. The aim is for these updates to be small and manageable, incrementally addressing issues and problems raised by you. Selenium 2.1, which is launched today, marks the first of these regular, small releases.
Selenium 2.1 is largely focused on improving Grid with a host of minor improvements including better tracking of “orphaned” browser instances.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 2.0: Out Now!</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0/</guid><description>We are very, very pleased to announce the release of Selenium 2.0. If you’ve been waiting for a stable release since 1.0.3, now’s the chance to update. And if you do, what will you find?
For users of Selenium 1, this is a drop-in replacement. You’ll find support for modern browsers such as Firefox 5 and IE 9, as well as a wealth of bug fixes and stability improvements.

There are the client APIs, which you use in your tests, and there’s a server part, which the client APIs know how to start and run and which takes the form of an executable called “chromedriver”.

We very quickly got some feedback that encouraged us to push a 2.0rc2. Now, after just under three weeks, we’re launching a third and final release candidate. You can download it from the Selenium HQ site or directly from Google Code.

We’d been really pleased to get Selenium 2.0rc1 out, so we were pretty disappointed to hear that some of you were running into problems with the Java version of the IE driver not launching IE sometimes. That’s definitely not good, so we fixed the problems and have released Selenium 2.0rc2. It’s the same as rc1, but with fewer problems 🙂

You can download it now (http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-remote-control-1.0.3.zip).
There is no functional difference between this version and 1.0.2, other than it is packaged up a little nicer and we’ve clarified the relationship between selenium-server and the client drivers. That is: we are not releasing new client drivers with future 1.x releases. The reason is that we locked down the API in version 1.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 1.0.2 Released: Firefox 3.6 and Snow Leopard Support</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-1-0-2-release-firefox-3-6-and-snow-leopard-support/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-1-0-2-release-firefox-3-6-and-snow-leopard-support/</guid><description>Today we’re happy to announce that Selenium Remote Control 1.0.2 has been released.
